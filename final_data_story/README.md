## Final Data Story | "An Overlooked Partnership"


I have chosen to present my data in the format of an academic paper. I feel strongly that historical research should better incorporate computerized text analysis, and so I wanted to model this approach in my own work.

The only file in this folder is a PDF of my paper. It is entitled, "An Overlooked Partnership: Python Probes 1840." 

ABSTRACT:
The project employs computer generated-text analysis to decipher and make sense of the year 1840 in Black abolitionist rhetoric, 1830-1861. There is much literature on the abolitionist movement in general. But the diversity of methodologies is rather slim. Few researchers make use of computer-generated text analysis. This project, thus, has two aims. One, it looks to fill the methodological gap in the scholarship and demonstrate that python is a viable and potent tool of historical research. Two, it aims to build on the existing literature. It will prove – or reject – three of the scholarship’s main hypotheses regarding Black abolitionist rhetoric. Scholars argue that Black abolitionist rhetoric became more civic-oriented and nationalistic, increasingly focused on self-identification, and progressively more demanding after the year 1840. I will operationalize these variables and test them in my data analysis.

It is about 3,500 words with a few tables, a diagram, and an apendix. Please enjoy.
