## Overview | An Overlooked Partnership: Python Probes 1840

Welcome to my exciting text analysis project. It is entitled, "An Overlooked Partnership: Python Probes 1840." It explores the meaning of the year 1840 for Black Abolitionist rhetoric.

ABSTRACT:

The project employs computer generated-text analysis to decipher and make sense of the year 1840 in Black abolitionist rhetoric, 1830-1861. There is much literature on the abolitionist movement in general. But the diversity of methodologies is rather slim. Few researchers make use of computer-generated text analysis. This project, thus, has two aims. One, it looks to fill the methodological gap in the scholarship and demonstrate that python is a viable and potent tool of historical research. It will show the power of Python in assembling and analyzing a 750 document corpus. Two, it aims to build on the existing literature. It will prove – or reject – three of the scholarship’s main hypotheses regarding Black abolitionist rhetoric. Scholars argue that Black abolitionist rhetoric became more civic-oriented and nationalistic, increasingly focused on self-identification, and progressively more demanding after the year 1840. The paper will operationalize these variables and test them in its data analysis.

FOLDER ROAD MAP:

* “DATA” FOLDER | You will find the ~750 Black abolitionist speeches that make up my corpus. I scraped each from the University of Detroit Mercy’s online archive of Black abolitionist writings. They range in publication date from 1830 to 1861. You can access the whole archive here: https://libraries.udmercy.edu/find/special_collections/digital/baa/index.php. You will also see a folder named "clean." This includes my two cleaned and sorted corpora by year, those composed during and before 1840 and those composed after 1840. One is entitled “clean_pages_pre_1840” and the other “clean_pages_post_1840.”

* “DATA_ANALYSIS” FOLDER | You will find two sets of documents here. You will see my three coding documents. These include “ScrapANDdownloadPDFs”, “Clean Corpus”, and “Analysis work.” In other words, in these documents I scraped the online archive for the building blocks of my corpus. I cleaned the documents and organized them into two distinct corpora, one of pre-1840 writings and the other of post-1840 writings. And then I analyzed these corpora.

* “FINAL_DATA_STORY” FOLDER | You can find my final paper here. Enjoy!

* “PRESENTATION” FOLDER | You can find a preliminary presentation – a PowerPoint saved as a PDF – of my data. It will give you a sense of what this project is all about and may be helpful if you lack the time to read my paper in full.
