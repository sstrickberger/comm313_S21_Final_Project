## Data | "An Overlooked Partnership"

Welcome to my data folder. 

* This folder contains the data of my final analysis. 

* DATA DESCRITPION | I have to types of documents. The first are my RAW DATA, which take up most of the folder. The second is my cleaned data, which I have in a folder called "clean."

(1) RAW DATA - You will find ~750 Black abolitionist PDF files in this folder. Each was published in the year 1830-1861. They include many of the “300 black abolitionists [that] were regularly involved in the antislavery movement, heightening its credibility and broadening its agenda.” 

(2) "CLEAN" DATA FOLDER - You will also see a folder named "clean." This includes my two cleaned and sorted corpora by year, those composed during and before 1840 and those composed after 1840. One is entitled “clean_pages_pre_1840.” There are about 500 pages in this corpus. The other “clean_pages_post_1840.” There are about 2,000 pages in this corpus.

I then sorted these pages into two corpora. One includes all pre-1840 texts (inclusive of those written in 1840) and the other includes all post-1840 texts. More info on them is below:

* RAW DATA SOURCE | I scraped these PDFs from the University of Detroit Mercy’s online archive of Black abolitionist writings. You can access the whole archive here: https://libraries.udmercy.edu/find/special_collections/digital/baa/index.php.
