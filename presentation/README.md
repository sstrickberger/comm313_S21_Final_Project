## Progress presentation for COMM313 Final Project

Welcome to my project presentation folder. 

* The presentation contains five slides that cover:
  1. My research topic: Black abolitionist rhetoric, 1830-1861.
  2. My data source: ~750 Black abolitionist writings pulled from the University of Detroit Mercy's "Black Abolitionist Archive"
  3. A hypothesis of mine: Black abolitionist rhetoric became more civic-oriented and nationalistic after 1840. 
         - (Note: My final project includes all three of my hypotheses.) 
    4. My test: I utilized frequency tests as a preliminary analysis to determine whether nationalistic and civic-oriented rhetoric was more common after 1840 or not.
    5. My results: I found that my hypothesis was correct. Such rhetoric was more frequent after 1840.
