', '', '   In addition to what has been already said on the  ', 'subject, I shall briefly set forth some of the leading  ', 'causes of our wretchedness and misery; and the  ', '', 'prominent motives of the Colonization Society in  ', '', 'sending us away.  Much theory has been used, in  ', '', 'the discussion upon our civil and political situation,  ', '', 'in this country.  We have been branded, in many  ', 'instances, ', ' may I not say, in the highest court of  ', 'the nation, courts of justice and equity, in public and  ', 'family circles? ', ' as being an inferior race of beings,  ', 'not possessing like intellect and faculty with the  ', 'whites.  We are represented as being incapable of  ', '', 'acting for ourselves; consequently not educated and  ', 'qualified to be admitted into public places, to vindi- ', 'cate the integrity of our race, and the qualifications  ', '', 'we are capable of acquiring.  Many of our noble  ', '', 'statesmen, orators and lawyers, have made our cap- ', 'itol ring with the empty sound of inferiority, ', ' de- ', 'gradation, ', ' the impossibility of tolerating equality  ', 'with the blacks.  Sacred writ has been carefully ex- ', 'amined by these gentlemen of science, and construed  ', '', 'to suit their narrow consciences.  Prophets have a- ', '', 'risen among them, who hold forth to the people, the  ', '', 'continuation of our political thraldom, unless there  ', '', 'be a general removal of all the free among us to the  ', 'coast of Africa.  Others argue, that, although they'], [' have good feelings towards us, and would do any  ', 'thing for us, if we were out of their sight and out of  ', '', 'hearing of their slaves, yet to admit us into their  ', '', 'circles would be to pervert the present order of so- ', '', 'ciety, and the happiness of the good white citizens  ', '', 'of the country.  These are generally bible men, such  ', '', 'as hold forth the true oracles of God; yet deny him,  ', '', 'in their actions and words, the supreme control over  ', 'all his creatures.  There is hardly ever an action per- ', 'formed, whether good or bad, but there is generally  ', '', 'a reason given for so doing; and he is a wicked,  ', '', 'daring character, who cannot find a cloak, at any  ', '', 'time, to cover his hideous crimes.  The men who have  ', '', 'been foremost, in withholding from us our dearest  ', '', 'and most sacred rights, have always held out false  ', '', 'colors to the community at large, (such as, inferi- ', '', 'ority, degradation, nuisance, pest, slaves, species of  ', 'monkey, apes, &c.) to justify their inhuman and  ', 'unchristian acts towards us, and to deaden the severe  ', '', 'pangs of conscience that harass them.  They would  ', '', 'wish to appear innocent before the world; as doing  ', '', 'unto all men as they would they should do unto them.   ', '', 'Do they base their objects, in full, upon such frivo- ', '', 'lous excuses as these?  No.  The truth is, actions  ', '', 'speak louder than words.  It is my candid opinion,  ', '', 'there would have been no Colonization Society  ', 'formed for our transportation to the western coast of  ', 'Africa, had there been no free colored people, and  ', '', 'did not our numbers increase daily.  If we, as a free  ', '', 'body of people, had remained in the same character  ', '', 'with slaves, monkeys and baboons, there would not  ', '', 'have been so much excitement in the community a- ', '', 'bout us; but as they see, by our improvement, (a'], [' great improvement, indeed, within forty years,) that  ', 'the period is hastening on, when there will be no  ', '', 'other alternative but we must rank among them in  ', '', 'civilization, science and politics, they have got up  ', '', 'this colonization scheme to persuade us to leave our  ', '', 'slave brethren, and flee to the pestilential shores of  ', '', 'Africa, where we shall be in danger of being forced  ', '', 'to hang our harps upon the willows, and our song of  ', 'liberty and civilization will be hushed by the impell- ', 'ing force of barbarian despots. ', '', '   The present situation of our free colored people  ', '', 'has awakened general concern, and aroused general  ', '', 'sympathy in the community, so as to call for their  ', '', 'charities to be appropriated, not to the advancement  ', '', 'of civilization, education, arts and sciences, and the  ', '', 'elevation of our moral, civil and political character  ', '', 'in this country; but, on the contrary, to send us to  ', 'an unknown land, that we can no more justly claim  ', 'than the whites of this country can the continent of  ', '', 'Europe, where we shall be forced to sever the bonds  ', '', 'of affection with our slave brethren, and leave all  ', 'that is near and dear to us, ', ' the ties of country, and  ', 'the graves of our fathers.  Can such charities pro- ', 'ceed from a christian source?  I am persuaded, they  ', 'are based upon prejudice, pride, ambition, jealousy,  ', '', 'hatred, malice, and impure heart; from whence every  ', '', 'other black art has its origin.  And why?  Because  ', '', 'our color and features do not exactly resemble theirs.   ', '', 'If their sympathies proceed from christian principles,  ', '', 'why not adopt the measures taken by patriarch  ', '', 'Abraham and his nephew Lot, as there is plenty of  ', '', 'land on the right hand and on the left, to satisfy the  ', 'calls of humanity?  If that would not answer, why'], ['  not purchase the Texas, or some other neighboring  ', '', 'province, and cede it to us, as a pledge of their faith  ', '', 'towards us, whom they have so long injured; and  ', '', 'break the bonds of slavery asunder at the south, that  ', '', 'two millions of us may, like ancient Israel, march  ', '', 'forward with our flocks, our herds, our wives, and  ', '', 'our little ones, to a country where we shall not be  ', 'so much exposed to the seas and the pestilential va- ', 'pors of the torrid zone?  The reasons are obvious.   ', '', 'Their hearts are hardened against us, like haughty  ', '', 'Pharaoh™s, who would not let Israel go, until visited  ', '', 'by severe plagues and the judgements of an angry  ', '', 'God, who cannot endure and will not uphold injus- ', '', 'tice exercised upon one of his creatures. ', '', '   The profits arising from the sweat and blood of  ', '', 'our brethren, together with the existing ignorance a- ', 'mong us, is the cause of much interest and specula- ', 'tion among our enemies, both in the slaveholding  ', '', 'and non-slaveholding States.  So far as we become  ', '', 'civilized and educated, so far their interest, in the  ', '', 'bones and muscles of our brethren, is at stake[.]   ', '', 'Hence the object of colonizing us on the shores of  ', '', 'Africa; whom they represent as a pest, a nuisance;  ', '', 'and who are likely to lead the slaves to insubordina- ', '', 'tion.  Many have bitterly denied these assertions;  ', 'but as a specimen of their good feelings towards us,  ', 'we will refer, for our satisfaction, to some of the  ', '', 'late resolutions of Virginia, North Carolina, South  ', '', 'Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana; more particularly,  ', '', 'the ordinances of Charleston, Savannah, and New- ', '', 'Orleans; where we, as free people, are not allowed  ', '', 'to set foot upon their shores, except under certain re- ', '', 'strictions; and in some of those places the masters'], ['  of vessels are subject to a heavy fine, for bringing  ', '', 'any of us into their ports; and the persons brought  ', '', 'are imprisoned, and their backs lacerated with a cow- ', '', 'skin, cart-whip, or whatever unholy weapon the  ', '', 'deluded hearts of slaveholders may direct them to.   ', '', 'Many of those wretches are colonization men, who  ', '', 'wish to send us across the Atlantic ocean, with the  ', 'pleasing phantom of elevating us to rank, riches,  ', 'wreaths and laurels.  It is my opinion, that some of  ', '', 'their hearts are so deluded, that, were it not for the  ', '', 'blush of humanity and national honor, they would  ', '', 'adopt similar measures taken by the French, at the  ', '', 'commencement of the Haytian revolution, and col- ', '', 'onize us in the depths of the ocean. ', '', '   In thus speaking, I do no presume to suspect our  ', '', 'white brethren collectively; for I believe we have  ', 'sincere friends among them, who are day and night  ', 'studying for our interest and welfare.  We believe  ', '', 'there are more than seven thousand of them who  ', '', 'have not bowed the knee to the modern Baal, the  ', '', 'god of prejudice, pride, and ambition. ', '', '   Such [are] the existing animosities against us, that  ', '', 'we do not feel very safe at home among our friends:  ', '', 'how, then, can we feel secure in a colony established  ', '', 'by slaveholders? ', '   The truth is, brethren, God is at work; though,  ', 'to some of us, reformation seems slow in its progress.   ', '', 'Our situation appears abject and mean; that of our  ', '', 'slave brethren, degrading almost with the brute cre- ', '', 'ation.  This state of things has remained for a long  ', '', 'time; while almost every other relic of barbarism  ', '', 'has been done away by the rapid march of reform.   ', '', 'Yet, however, we have reason to be thankful, that'], ['  much has been done, and is doing, to put a stop to  ', '', 'the unjust existence of slavery.  Some thousands of  ', '', 'us have emerged from that deplorable state into nom- ', 'inal freedom, ', ' a medium between genuine liberty  ', 'and abject slavery.  Genuine liberty consists of lib- ', 'erty of conscience and of person, both civil and po- ', '', 'litical.  We are placed in this intermediate situation,  ', '', 'as the objects of God™s particular care; the forerun- ', '', 'ner of some better enjoyment, which is hastening on  ', '', 'with rapid strides.  Nothing can prove more influen- ', '', 'tial, in the setting forth a universal concern for our  ', '', 'welfare in this country, our native home, than a gen- ', '', 'eral union of interest to raise funds and promote ed- ', 'ucation.  Our present situation will afford means to  ', 'acquire these blessings, which are the avenues that  ', '', 'will lead us to recover our long lost rights, guaran- ', '', 'teed to us by the sacred declaration of our country™s  ', '', 'independence.  These measures have been too long  ', '', 'hid from us under the shades of obscurity, occasioned  ', '', 'by ignorance, &c.  We have remained silent too  ', '', 'long, on the subject of our present thraldom, and suf- ', '', 'fered reproaches to be heaped upon us without an- ', 'swering to the many wrongs wickedly charged against  ', 'us.  Our hands have been too slack in offering our  ', '', 'charities, to be appropriated to our general good;  ', '', 'while the whites of every name and every denomi- ', 'nation are bound together by this one, common tie ', ' the public interest. ', '   It is time, my brethren, for us to consider minute- ', 'ly, and weigh deeply, matters connected with our  ', '', 'national welfare, and take the example of our white  ', '', 'brethren, and do away every petty local prejudice,'], ['    Since we have been brought out of darkness into  ', 'light, we discover something ahead that we have not  ', 'yet come up to.

If so, we would have  ', 'but little faith in such a warfare.  What recompense  ', '', 'did the blacks get in fighting for liberty in the war  ', 'of the revolution?

It is female influence'], [' that polishes the manners and elevates  ', 'the mind of man.  She is the ornament  ', '', 'of his life, the kind protectress of his  ', '', 'peace and comfort, and her heart is the  ', '', 'home of his affection and love.  Well  ', '', 'may it be said, there is no place under  ', '', 'the broad canopy of heaven, no condition,  ', '', 'situation, or circumstances, into which  ', 'female influence may not enter, either  ', 'for good or for evil, a blessing or a curse.   ', '', 'And every day™s experience convinces  ', '', 'us that their influence upon the charac- ', '', 'ter and happiness of man is very great.   ', '', 'It is to woman that we are indebted for  ', '', 'the formation of characters: she is with  ', '', 'us through life, nourishes us through sick- ', '', 'ness, sooths us in distress, and sustains  ', 'us in adversity. ', '   2d.  Charity, or benevolence, in its gene- ', '', 'ral acceptation, means to do good, and it  ', '', 'also implies love.  It is one of the no- ', '', 'blest virtues, because it is distributive,  ', '', 'and looks abroad from self, and embraces  ', '', 'the whole human family, without regard  ', '', 'to condition or circumstances.  If Paul,  ', '', 'in speaking of this virtue, as if to say it  ', 'was the basis, the key-stone of the Chris- ', 'tian religion, exclaims, ﬁthough I speak  ', '', 'with the tongues of men and angels, and  ', '', 'have not charity, I am become as sound- ', '', 'ing brass, or a tinkling cymbal.ﬂ  And  ', '', 'this apostle urged in the most empathic'], [' and soul-stirring language, the ', 'duty', ' of  ', 'Christians to be charitable.  And so far  ', '', 'as my knowledge of the scriptures ex- ', '', 'tends, there seems to be more precepts,  ', '', 'greater efficacy, and higher promises set  ', '', 'upon charity than there is upon almost  ', '', 'any other virtue.  We find it ranked with  ', '', 'righteousness, and according to the sacred  ', 'text, made almost equivalent to it.  In  ', 'view of these facts, I am often amazed at  ', '', 'the apathy of Christians to this sacred  ', '', 'duty, and the conduct of many is truly  ', '', 'inexplicable.  For instance I have known  ', '', 'Christians refuse to bestow alms upon  ', '', 'those of a different complexion or coun- ', '', 'try, and give, as a reason, that those indi- ', '', 'viduals had brought poverty and ruin  ', 'upon themselves, by their vices: but if  ', 'they were actuated by the spirit of a cer- ', '', 'tain heathen philosopher of antiquity,  ', '', 'who, when censured for bestowing alms  ', '', 'upon a worthless fellow, replied, that he  ', '', 'gave not to the ', 'manners', ', but to the ', 'man', 'Š they certainly would not act so inconsist- ', '', 'ently. ', '', '   Besides, the scriptures declared the re- ', 'ward of charity is not so much to those  ', 'who receive as to those who give.  It is  ', '', 'the duty of a good steward to provide for  ', '', 'the members of the family, and the poor  ', '', 'and destitute being a part of God™s family,  ', '', 'Christians discharge not their duty, un-'], ['  less these are provided for.  And I some- ', '', 'times have thought, that this duty was  ', '', 'more strictly enjoined upon the American  ', '', 'people than any other nation under  ', '', 'heaven, because of the nature of their  ', '', 'institutions, and because of their loud pre- ', '', 'tensions to christianity. ', '   Charity is a meek and blessed influ- ', 'ence, stealing, as it were, unawares upon  ', '', 'the heart:  It does not excite and rouse  ', '', 'up the passions, and it is untrammeled by  ', '', 'religious creeds.  It strengthnes and in- ', '', 'vigorates our characters, and glows with  ', '', 'the spirit of love.  It is spread out like a  ', '', 'legible language upon the broad face  ', '', 'of nature, and it uplifts the spirit within  ', 'us, and enables us to overlook the frail- ', 'ties and weaknesses of human nature. Š ', '', 'Let us be diligent, my friends, in cultiva- ', '', 'ting this virtue.  It tends to awaken and  ', '', 'bring out the finer feelings of our nature,  ', '', 'and it naturally leads us to follow the rule,  ', '', 'to ﬁdo unto others as  you wish others to  ', '', 'do unto you;ﬂ and to ﬁlove our neigh- ', '', 'bours as ourselves.ﬂ  If we were actu- ', 'ated by these glorious principles, poverty  ', 'and degradation in all their multiplied  ', '', 'forms would soon be removed, and we  ', '', 'should stand forth ﬁredeemed, regenera- ', '', 'ted, and disenthralled.ﬂ ', '', '   I recollect an instance in the city of  ', '', 'Baltimore, of a lady who once had been'], [' in comfortable circumstances, but by a  ', 'series of misfortunes, was reduced to  ', '', 'poverty.  Had it not been for the Dorcas  ', '', 'Society, of which she was a member, she  ', '', 'would have been thrown upon the tender  ', '', 'mercies of the world, or have suffered  ', '', 'for the necessaries of life.  But they, like  ', '', 'the good Samaritan, snatched her from  ', 'the jaws of death, poured balm into her  ', 'wounds, and consolation into her heart.   ', '', 'Here we have, ladies, a striking instance  ', '', 'of the efficacy of a union of feeling and  ', '', 'action.  No one individual, nor probably  ', '', 'two or three, could have maintained that  ', '', 'lady without inconvenience, but by the  ', '', 'union of many it was done without any  ', '', 'great tax upon the members, either of  ', 'time or money. ', '   As we are at best but poor, dependent  ', '', 'creatures, it matters not how wealthy or  ', '', 'exalted our situation, still we are de- ', '', 'pendent creatures, and liable to the same  ', '', 'misfortunes as others; consequently, it is  ', '', 'our duty, aside from feelings of sympathy  ', '', 'and benevolence, it is our duty, as mem- ', '', 'bers of the human family, and members  ', 'of the community in which we live, to as- ', 'sist the poor and destitute, not knowing  ', '', 'how soon we may stand in need of assist- ', '', 'ance ourselves.

', 'He alluded to the great monster prejudice, under whose  ', '', 'vile torture the man of color had been made the object of  ', '', 'so much suffering.  He also pointed out its antidote.   ', '', '   The evils of slavery were pictured out in all its horrors,  ', '', 'in a manner truly touching.

The participations in the achievements of American  ', '', 'Liberty by many of the sable sons whose children are  ', '', 'now denied the enjoyment of that blessing, hooted and  ', '', 'despised, was drawn up in a masterly style.  The opinion  ', '', 'of posterity of Liberty, as it now exists in this country,  ', '', 'and the duty of Christians in regard to the momentous  ', '', 'subject of slavery, were clearly pointed out.  The right- ', '', 'eousness and durability of anti-slavery principles, and  ', 'their philanthropic supporters were eulogized, and high  ', 'encomium paid to Great Britain for her many humane and  ', '', 'benevolent acts. ', '', '   The speaker dwelt at some considerable length in a pan- ', '', 'egyric on literature, as essential to the full enjoyment of  ', '', 'liberty; and the young men received a handsome compli- ', '', 'ment for the proficiency they had made in their endeavors  ', '', 'to attain a knowledge of the fine arts.  The opponents of  ', '', 'these principles did not escape that severe sarcasm, which  ', 'usually falls to their lot.'], ['     In fine, the gentleman discovered much taste in the se- ', '', 'lection of ideas and the whole management of his subject.'], ['    Mr. President', '  I regret that an individual possessing  ', 'the ability of that gentleman, should in the nineteenth  ', 'century undertake to justify that infamous system of  ', '', 'slavery, which is practised upon my brethren at the  ', '', 'South.  He has referred to the constitution, to prove  ', 'that abolitionists are not entitled to the privileges of  ', 'American citizens.  Sir, that constitution will bear  ', '', 'them out.  There is not a solitary word about slavery  ', '', 'in that constitution.  The word slave is not in it.  The  ', '', 'constitution merely recognizes indirectly its existence,  ', '', 'in some of its provisions.  There was a compromise  ', '', 'made, that the slave states should be entitled to a rep- ', '', 'resentation for three fifths of their slave population;  ', '', 'and that slaves who escape should be delivered up to  ', 'their masters.  But so cautious were the framers of  ', 'that instrument, to avoid recognizing slavery as a part  ', '', 'of our systems; and so conscious were they of its re- ', '', 'pugnance to the very spirit of our institutions, that  ', '', 'their provisions were made without introducing into  ', '', 'that sacred instrument the word slave or slavery.  And  ', '', 'it is evident that this compromise, so far from amount- ', '', 'ing to a perpetual guarantee of slavery, was, on all  ', '', 'hands, considered as but a ', 'temporary', ' arrangement.  This  ', 'may be learned from the speech of Mr. Madison, in the  ', 'Virginia convention, for the adoption of the federal con- ', '', 'stitution.  Sir, the spirit of abolition was born in Vir- ', '', 'ginia.  If I am not mistaken, a resolution was introduc- ', '', 'ed against this slave representation.  Mr. Madison says,  ', '', '‚The Southern states will not enter into this union, un- ', '', 'less they are permitted a ', 'temporary', ' continuance of this  ', 'system.™ ', '', '   The gentleman has also gone back to ancient times.   ', 'He has referred us to the case of Joseph.  Joseph was'], ['  a Hebrew.  He was ', 'stolen', '.  What does he say?  ‚In- ', 'deed, I was ', 'stolen away', ' out of the land of the Hebrews.™   ', 'Is there not robbery?  Joseph was the first slave that  ', '', 'we read of, and he, speaking by divine inspiration,  ', '', 'calls it robbery.  Slavery is founded in fraud.   ', '', '   Again, the gentleman alluded to historical facts.  Sir,  ', '', 'we can trace the ', 'modern origin of chattel slavery.  ', 'The  ', 'first slave ship fitted out to the coast of Africa, was in  ', 'the reign of Charles V.; and King William was the first  ', '', 'that granted a patent to a company of merchants to go  ', '', 'to the cost of Africa, and entrap the natives, and sell  ', '', 'them into bondage.  When this country was first dis- ', 'covered by Columbus, that man was a slaveholder ', ' a  ', 'slave dealer.  He undertook to enslave the aborigines  ', 'of this country.  He sent 300 of them over to Spain, to  ', '', 'be sold as slaves.  But, there was a spark of humanity  ', '', 'then remaining in Spain, which was shocked at the  ', '', 'thought of such a deed.  Queen Elizabeth sent back  ', '', 'these men.   ', '', '   Sir, it is treachery to the sacred cause of liberty for  ', '', 'one man to enslave another.  That spirit which enslaves  ', '', 'my colored brother at the South, would enslave every  ', 'man in this house.  It is not because we are ', 'black', ', that  ', 'our race is enslaved.  It is that domineering spirit that  ', '', 'would enslave every man if it had the power.  The  ', 'spirit of abolition is, to ', 'do righteousness', '  not do as you  ', 'would expect the slave to do, if he were in your place;  ', 'but to do all mankind what you would have them do  ', 'to you. ', '   But further, I say the argument of that gentleman is  ', '', 'too late', '.  The institution of slavery is already tottering.   ', 'The day is gone by, for the talking of its perpetuity.  The'], ['  death-war has begun.  Under this whole system are  ', '', 'the fires of a volcano, which, if not quenched, will pro- ', '', 'duce, ere long, a terrible explosion.  Here comes in  ', '', 'the principle of abolition, to quench these fires, by heal- ', '', 'ing up the wounds of the slave, which furnish them with  ', '', 'fuel.  Unless the holders of slaves will ', 'do justice', ', the  ', 'decree of heaven has gone out for their overthrow.  All  ', 'injustice must ultimately call down the vengeance of  ', 'the God of the oppressed; and all slavery is injustice.'], [' RESPECTED FRIENDS: ', '   We are engaged in a good work, and to ac- ', '', 'complish it, we need your aid in extending the  ', '', 'principle of total abstinence from the use of  ', '', 'all intoxicating liquors as a drink.  The sup- ', '', 'pression of intemperance and its kindred vices  ', '', 'was the object for which the New England  ', '', 'Temperance Society was formed in 1836,  ', 'composed of members from different parts of  ', 'the country, of talents and influence, recom- ', '', 'mending the organization of auxiliary associa- ', '', 'tions to co-operate in giving system and efficien- ', '', 'cy to such measures as might be deemed ex- ', '', 'pedient to be adopted. ', '', '   We doubt not we express the views and  ', '', 'feelings of every good colored person in the  ', '', 'city, when we say, that we have each and all  ', 'a personal interest, as well as a duty, in exert- ', 'ing our influence towards the promotion of our  ', '', 'welfare.  There are no individuals among us  ', '', 'who are wealthy, or have the means of making  ', '', 'a fortune: however, we all have a comfortable  ', '', 'subsistence, and if we make a judicious use of  ', '', 'the means we possess, we may become a use- ', '', 'ful, prosperous, united and happy people. ', '', '   I do not believe that the evils of intemper- ', 'ance prevail among us as a people, to any  ', 'greater extent than among the white class of  ', '', 'the community: in fact, I believe that we are  ', '', 'less addicted to the use of strong drink.  Still,  ', '', 'we need a reformation, in this particular; and  ', '', 'we ought to be careful to abandon those vices  ', '', 'which are ruinous to virtue, to the improve-'], [' ment of the mind, and the progressive elevation  ', 'of character. ', '', '   Intemperance is a leading sin: it opens the  ', '', 'door to a train of evils, the neglect of the Sab- ', '', 'bath, inattention to temporal affairsŠit leads  ', '', 'man to squander away that property which  ', '', 'ought to be applied to useful purposes, and pre- ', '', 'vents him from discharging honest debts, and  ', 'also deprives society of a useful man.  The  ', 'direct tendency of intemperance is to indo- ', '', 'lence, poverty and ruin; and those who prac- ', '', 'tise the evil know not what crimes they shall  ', '', 'be left to perpetrate.  Intemperance is a vio- ', '', 'lation of the laws of nature, and of nature™s  ', '', 'God; for it sinks human nature below the  ', '', 'brute, and man becomes an enemy to himself.   ', '', 'It leads to practical impiety, sows the seeds of  ', 'infidelity, and sets at defiance all religious prin- ', 'ciples.  The sin of intemperance is not a sin  ', '', 'of ignorance, and those who practise it must  ', '', 'feel themselves to be transgressors.  It is ruin- ', '', 'ous to bodily health; and if the intellectual  ', '', 'powers are seated in the head, we need not be  ', '', 'surprised that they suffer from the effects of  ', '', 'stimulating liquors upon the brain.  Intemper- ', '', 'ate persons are lost to all sense of decency,  ', 'and become the sport of the rabble: they do  ', 'not live out half their days.  Would to  ', '', 'God that females were never found enrolled  ', '', 'among this number; but they, too, often serve  ', '', 'to swell the list of victims. ', '', '   This great sin of intemperance is beginning  ', '', 'to be abhorred by all civilized nations.

The religion of Ma- ', '', 'homet utterly forbids the use of intoxicating  ', 'liquors; and that wise king, Solomon, says,  ', '‚Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging;  ', '', 'and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.

One  ', '', 'of them was a story about an abolition agent at Norris- ', '', 'town, refusing to ride in a car with colored people.'], [' This clergyman told it with great postiveness, and  ', 'dressed it up with all the particulars, and acted it all  ', '', 'out in a very theatrical manner, and every word was a  ', '', 'lie.  Another statement was about a church in Connec- ', '', 'ticut with regard to its colored members, which the  ', '', 'least pains might have satisfied him was all false.   ', '', 'Thus, you see, that when a minister goes to do the  ', '', 'devil™s work, he is, of all men, the most awkward and  ', 'ridiculous.   ', '   A few years ago, a good minister in this city gave  ', '', 'me some very severe remarks he had written against  ', '', 'the Colonization Society, and wished me to take them  ', '', 'to the New York Observer.  The editors refused to  ', '', '[publish them and when I returned them to him and]  ', '', 'told him, he was quite offended.  But soon [afterwards,]  ', '', 'the witty colonizationists found out a way to get over  ', '', 'this worthy brother™s objections.  They had a great  ', 'meeting to form a society here, and appointed this  ', 'same minister to present the constitution and make a  ', '', 'speech.  And he fell into the snare.   ', '', '   I have called on these brethren, and asked why they  ', '', 'wished us to go to Africa, and they say, because we  ', '', 'cannot be elevated here.  But why can we not enjoy  ', '', 'our equal rights and privileges here?  Because Chris- ', '', 'tians cannot be brought to do their duty, and to act ac- ', '', 'cording to the commands of Christ.  Is this not a sin,  ', 'then?  Yes.  And is it found among your people?   ', 'Yes.  Have you preached against it?  No.  Why  ', '', 'have you not?  Because I knew it would do no good.   ', '', 'So, here is a sin in the church which is too much for  ', '', 'the gospel, and is more than proof against the Son of  ', '', 'God!  O, if Satan had got hold of their scheme, he  ', '', 'would have vanquished the Lion of the tribe of Judah.'], [' But Satan did not know so much. ', '   Again, the same spirit that would drive us from our  ', '', 'country, colonizes us in the churches.  A few years  ', '', 'ago, a leading colonization minister, who lately made  ', '', 'a most extraordinary speech at Washington, invited  ', '', 'me with a portion of my people, to his communion.  It  ', '', 'so happened that I came rather late to the house, and  ', '', 'on looking around, I could not see any of my people.   ', 'I thought it strange, but presently one of the elders  ', 'came and invited me to a seat by the table, and there  ', '', 'I found my people hid away under the pulpit!  O,  ', '', 'dear hearers, judge not the gospel of Christ by these  ', '', 'men, but judge by other and better evidences of its  ', '', 'power.  We live in a day of apostasy, and time-serv- ', '', 'ing, and worldly policy; and these evil principles have  ', '', 'even crept into the pulpit.  I mourn over it.  I love  ', '', 'the ministry, and I pray God to bring them back; but  ', 'I boldly say that they have gone astray, and God is  ', 'chastening the church for it.  And if they are not  ', '', 'brought to repentance, these evils will prevail, until  ', '', 'the church is brought low, and then God will build it  ', '', 'up again, of better men, who will walk according to  ', '', 'the Golden Rule, that requires us to do unto others as  ', '', 'we would have them do to us.     ', '', '   I hope nothing I have said will lessen the reverence  ', '', 'of any present for religion.

A  ', '', 'victory, it is true, has been gained, but not of the'], ['   sword.  A mighty struggle has been engaged in,  ', '', 'not between physical, but moral forces; and the re- ', '', 'sult has been, as it always will ultimately be, on  ', '', 'the side of justice, humanity and truth.  Well then  ', 'may they rejoice; for heretofore they were held by  ', 'their fellow-men as slaves, (they recently bore the  ', '', 'name of ﬁindentured apprentices,ﬂ) but now they  ', '', 'are freemen', ', in the strict sense of that term.

Whatever has been done  ', '', 'in the British West Indies, our condition, in point'], ['  of fact, remains the same.  But with all these ad- ', '', 'missions, still the act referred to is far from being  ', '', 'totally without benefit to us.  So far as the spread  ', '', 'of correct principles, on the great subject of human  ', 'rights is concerned, we are materially benefitted. ', '  For, since the principle of moral justice has success- ', 'fully triumphed over wrong and outrage ', 'there', ', can  ', 'it be without its influence in bringing about the  ', '', 'same glorious result ', 'here', ', when the like opposing  ', 'elements are now on each side, so earnestly conten- ', 'ding for the mastery?  Why, before the noble deed  ', 'we now celebrate, can fail to have this tendency,  ', 'the very nature of man must change ', ' he must cease  ', 'to be affected by the example of his fellow man. ', '   Furthermore, it is our duty as men, and more espe- ', 'cially as christians, who should rejoice in the grow- ', '', 'ing prosperity of all, not only to ﬁweep with them  ', '', 'that weep, to remember them that are in bonds as  ', '', 'bound with them,ﬂ but it is also enjoined upon us  ', '', 'to ﬁrejoice with them that do rejoice.ﬂ ', '', '   To mark the day in a special manner with those  ', '', 'of our brethren who are more directly interested, is,  ', 'therefore, highly proper and becoming.  And I  ', 'know of no way in which we can better honor the  ', '', 'day that practically declares man free, than by de- ', '', 'voting it, as we now do, to promoting the cause of  ', '', 'moral and religious education, among the young  ', '', 'and rising generation.  The responsibility of pa- ', '', 'rents, in the moral training of their children, has  ', '', 'been clearly set before you, by the friend who pre- ', '', 'ceded me.  It devolves upon me to make a few  ', 'remarks, by way of address, to the Sabbath School  ', 'Teachers.  In doing this we shall be very brief, as'], ['   it is our design simply to lay before them the im- ', '', 'portance of giving a moral and religious direction,  ', '', 'in all the instructions they impart to their pupils.  ', '', '   As it is generally admitted that Sunday Schools  ', 'have been established for the express purpose of  ', 'impressing moral and religious truths upon the  ', '', 'youthful mind, calling your attention to this subject  ', '', 'may be thought unnecessary.  But though the reli- ', '', 'gious character of these institutions be generally  ', '', 'acknowledged, we fear that in too many instances it  ', '', 'is lost sight of.  Are not teachers found very fre- ', '', 'quently employing a considerable portion of time in  ', '', 'merely teaching children the alphabet, or the art of  ', 'spelling?  Now we hesitate not in saying, that  ', 'this practice, in our opinion, is utterly derogatory to  ', '', 'the design and character of Sunday Schools.  Can  ', '', 'it be supposed that these institutions were intended  ', '', 'to supply the place of primary day schools, in in- ', '', 'structing the young in the rudiments of learning?   ', '', 'The few hours passed in them would not be suffi- ', '', 'cient for this, had they been originally established  ', '', 'with this view.  ', '   But do not misunderstand us here, and suppose  ', 'we would recommend the dismissal of all who do  ', '', 'not know how to read.  No; we would suggest  ', '', 'nothing of the kind.  What we would recommend  ', '', 'is, that the time too often consumed in teaching the  ', '', 'children at Sunday School A, B, C, be employed in  ', '', 'giving them oral instruction with regard to some  ', '', 'moral or religious duty.  We do not say you should  ', '', 'tire their patience with long and dry dissertations  ', 'on these points.  As you would not attempt to fill  ', 'a bottle, having a small neck, by throwing a great'], ['   quantity into it all at once, but would pour in a little  ', '', 'at a time, neither should an attempt be made to  ', '', 'pour into the little minds of children a great flood  ', '', 'of light at once.  Special attention should be paid  ', 'to the Bible rule ', ' ﬁHere a little and there a little.ﬂ   ', 'Many deeply interesting truths may be impressed  ', 'upon the minds of children, long before they have  ', '', 'the forms of the different alphabetical characters im- ', '', 'pressed upon their memories.  Now it is evident  ', '', 'that if teachers always paid a practical attention to  ', 'this, they would not only act in strict accordance  ', 'with the spirit and design of the institution, but  ', '', 'would doubtless greatly contribute towards forming  ', '', 'the moral and religious character of the children  ', '', 'under their care.  But a deviation from this course  ', '', 'leaves the young mind open to impressions which  ', '', 'have a tendency to form an opposite character.      ', '', '   We believe the teachers are not chargeable to the  ', '', 'same extent, with regard to the character of their  ', 'nstructions to those who are able to read.  They  ', 'are not satisfied with knowing that this portion of  ', 'their pupils can rehearse their lessons correctly. ', ' They go a step further; they propound such ques- ', 'tions as will lead them rightly to understand what  ', '', 'they read.  And it is at this point that probably the  ', 'great majority of Sunday School Teachers stop: ', '  and in stopping here, we think their work is left  ', 'half done.  Is it enough that the young immortals  ', '', 'have their duties explained to them?  Should they  ', '', 'not be shown that they are personally interested in  ', '', 'them?  Should not motives be placed before their  ', 'minds, which have a tendency to lead them to the  ', 'performance of their duties?   Most assuredly.  But'], ['   what a falling off there is here, on the part of teach- ', '', 'ers!  How few advance this far in the instructions  ', '', 'they give their several classes!  We are aware that  ', '', 'a large number of teachers are young, amiable, and  ', 'well-disposed persons, but who, nevertheless, make  ', 'no pretensions to experimental religion; and that  ', '', 'they have a delicacy in carrying their instructions to  ', '', 'an extent so strictly religious.  Whether or not  ', '', 'their delicacy arises from the fear of having their  ', '', 'consciences troubled on the ground of inconsistency,  ', '', 'we pretend not to say.  But whatever delicacy there  ', '', 'may be in the minds of such, it certainly cannot  ', '', 'justify them in their course.   ', '   The Sunday School institution designs, as you  ', 'know, through the divine blessing, to bring the pu- ', '', 'pils early to know, love, and obey their Maker; to  ', '', 'do unto all men as they would be done by; to obey  ', '', 'the civil authority; to be true and just in all their  ', '', 'dealings; in a word, the high object it has in view  ', '', 'is, that they may live ﬁsoberly, righteously, and  ', '', 'godly, in this present evil world.ﬂ  And she would  ', '', 'have her teachers never to lose sight of this.  In all  ', 'their efforts she would have them steadily aiming to  ', 'accomplish the desired object.  If, while the teacher  ', '', 'is illustrating and enforcing these duties, the cutting  ', '', 'rebuke, ﬁPhysician, heal thyself,ﬂ should be bro™t  ', '', 'home to his conscience, instead of regarding this as  ', '', 'a reason why he should be less pointed and practical  ', '', 'in his remarks, it should stimulate him to greater  ', '', 'perseverance, as he would, by so doing, experience  ', 'the truth of that declaration ', ' \"He that watereth  ', 'shall be watered himself also.ﬂ   ', '   Then let no consideration divert your attention'], ['                          ', 'AN ADDRESS, &c.

When I cast my eye over this respectable and enlightened con- ', '', 'gregation, I see that the doctrines of this resolution will be responded to by  ', '', 'every intelligent mind.  Let me take a view of what American Slavery is.   ', 'It consists in this: in making men chattels; in brutalizing the image of  ', 'God, the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ; impressing its seal on  ', '', 'childhood, and wresting from the hand of the rightful owner that exercise  ', '', 'of the judgment for which he is accountable only to God.  It denies to the  ', '', 'slaves, and in many parts of the country to the free colored people also,  ', '', 'access to that heavenly chart, which is laid down by Jehovah as the only  ', '', 'safe rule of faith and practice, the liberty of reading and understanding how  ', '', 'he may serve God acceptably.  It withholds from him all the proceeds of  ', '', 'his labor, except a scanty subsistence, and two suits of clothing in a year,  ', '', 'of the coarsest description.  Is it morally right and politically safe to abol- ', 'ish such a system immediately? ', '   Let us look at the evidences.  They are not drawn from the days of Han- ', '', 'nibal, nor from a period a thousand years back, nor even one hundred years  ', '', 'since; but from to-dayŠfrom things as they are, and may be seen to beŠ ', '', 'at our own timesŠnow. ', '', '   The first evidence I will give, is that of the slaveholders themselves.   ', '', 'They are certainly good witnesses.  In their daily papers, you will see, at  ', '', 'any time, advertisements for the sale of ten, twenty, fifty, or one hundred  ', '', 'valuable negroes, recommended and qualified in such terms as these: Jack,  ', 'a good farmer; Joe, a skilful carpenter; Bob, a first-rate shoemaker; Jim,  ', 'a capital blacksmith, fully guarantied; Bets, a good washerwoman; Nell, a  ', '', 'faithful nurse; Sall, a seamstress, fully guarantied.  Is not that evidence  ', '', 'that they may be safely made free?  If, under the oppressions of slavery,  ', '', 'they can become skilful mechanics, trusty housekeepers, and safe nurses,  ', '', 'would they be less so, if made fully free.  I trow not.  If they sustain so'], ['   much moral worth while crowded within the small circle which slavery  ', '', 'allows, what would they not exhibit, if placed in circumstances to develop  ', '', 'all the powers with which they are endowed by a beneficent Creator? ', '', '   In the second place, I will call your attention to the evidence from the  ', '', 'disposition that has been manifested by those who have already obtained  ', '', 'their freedom.  It is in evidence, that those who have been slaves, and who  ', '', 'have been liberated, by gift or will, or by their own industry, have ever  ', 'manifested the strongest and tenderest affection for the family of their for- ', 'mer masters.  I was once honored with a travelling connection in the Methodist  ', '', 'Episcopal Conference of Philadelphia, and labored in the peninsula between the  ', '', 'Delaware and Chesapeake bays, where I had great opportunity of becoming  ', '', 'acquainted with the disposition of the people of color.  I will say, that I do not  ', '', 'know of more ignorant people on earth, than many of the field hands on that  ', '', 'peninsula.  And I believe the mass of the whites are about as ignorant.  For,  ', '', 'once while I was travelling the Lewistown circuit, I was called to preach a ser- ', '', 'mon at the execution of two black men, one of whom had murdered his master.   ', '', 'A short time before, the Court of Oyer had sentenced a white man to death, for  ', 'murdering his wife and child, and he had been hanged.  About three weeks  ', 'afterwards, the court appointed for the trial of slaves sentenced these two black  ', '', 'men to death, and the time was appointed.  When we went from the prison to  ', '', 'the gallows, only a short distance, we found such a mass of people assembled,  ', '', 'with stands for the sale of cider, and cakes, and rum, that the sheriff could with  ', '', 'great difficulty force a passage.  And this, notwithstanding there had been a  ', '', 'white man hanged three weeks before.  Is not this evidence of the degradation  ', '', 'of the whites?  How, then, can you expect to find an enlightened community  ', '', 'of colored people among such masters? ', '   But I found many people of color, who had obtained their freedom, and had  ', 'purchased lots, and built cabins, where they had their pigs and chickens, and  ', '', 'seemed to be comfortable and improving.  I have seen the children of their  ', '', 'former masters come to these people and ask for something to eat, and I have  ', '', 'seen every thing of the best in the cabin provided for them.  I asked one aged  ', '', 'woman, ﬁSister Judy, who was that young lady I saw here?ﬂ ﬁAh!ﬂ said'], ['  she, ﬁit was my old master™s daughter: many time I have been severely beaten  ', '', 'for her sake; but, poor thing, she is very poor now, and has nothing but what  ', '', 'her friends give her.  I forgive her now, and look to God for my reward.  I have  ', '', 'no right to take vengeance, and I do the best I can for her, when she comes here,  ', '', 'to get something good to eat.ﬂ  Here is the evidence.  Shall such benevolence  ', '', 'as this, when exhibited by those who have every reason to take vengeance, be  ', '', 'passed by?  Shall those who have such a spirit be kept in bondage? ', '   A third evidence to be considered, is drawn from the general character of the  ', 'people of color, including their situation, and their ability to get along in the  ', '', 'world.  Let it be remembered, that the man of color has to labor against wind  ', '', 'and tide, to meet all the prejudices, and contend with all the proscription and  ', '', 'opposition of the times.  Notwithstanding this, I can show that the colored  ', '', 'man is capable of making headway under all his disadvantages.  Go with me to  ', '', 'Baltimore, and in Howard-street, we will find a man of color who, seven years  ', '', 'ago, paid $600 for his own body and soul, and $300 or more for his wife: now he  ', '', 'owns nearly a block of ground, with three brick houses, two of which would  ', '', 'rent in New-York for $300 a piece, and the other for $700, besides several wooden  ', 'tenements.  Come to Philadelphia, and there is a man named Hales, who has  ', 'twice paid $350 for himself, being cheated out of the first payment by his ', 'humane  master.  Now he has on the front of his lot a three-story house, and on the rear,  ', '', 'such buildings as rent for more than $600 a-year. ', '', '   In Philadelphia, we have fourteen respectable congregations of colored people.   ', '', 'We own several churches that are worth from $25,000 to $50,000 each.  The  ', '', 'whole amount of our public property, in churches, school houses, and burial  ', '', 'grounds, is more than two hundred thousand dollars, the greater part paid for  ', '', 'by ourselves.  Several pay schools are supported by us.  About sixty beneficial  ', 'societies do much to provide for the sick and the helpless, and for the burial of  ', 'the dead, paying for these objects from eight to twelve thousand dollars a-year.   ', '', 'Not a colored person of any respectability, however poor, is buried at the expense  ', '', 'of the poor funds in Philadelphia.  In New-York, there are six or eight churches,  ', '', 'with beneficial societies, and schools, and other useful institutions.  So in other  ', '', 'cities.  It is true, we have in Philadelphia, and elsewhere, a low class of colored'], ['   people, who are both degraded and vicious: but who is to blame?  I live near  ', '', 'the church in which I have the honor to officiate; and in one square there are  ', '', 'fifteen grog-shops located, by the authority of the city; and in the immediate  ', '', 'neighborhood there are forty-five.  When ', 'you set the trap, is the rabbit to be  ', 'blamed for being caught?  The weary traveller or laborer is snared in the gins  ', '', 'that are set by those in authority, who ought to know better.  But amidst all  ', '', 'our difficulties, the man of color advances in a surprising degree.  And when the  ', 'people of color are compared with other portions of the laboring class in the com- ', 'munity, I venture to declare, that in regard to the number of the vicious and the  ', '', 'wretched, they will not overrun the common ratio. ', '', '   In the fourth place, I will notice the evidence drawn from the power of intel- ', '', 'lect exhibited by the man of color.  I know our heads have been measured, to  ', '', 'determine whether we had as much brains as blood.  I know that prejudice has  ', '', 'blinded the eyes of many who ought to have seen and acknowledged the truth.   ', '', 'I know the popular delusion everywhere prevailing, has extended its influence  ', '', 'even over ourselves; and that many among us have tacitly consented to admit  ', '', 'that we were an inferior race.  But I will appeal to facts.  I will mention one  ', 'case, and I am happy to see a reverend gentleman in the house who can attest  ', 'it.  There was a man, who used to travel with Bishop Asbury, named Henry  ', '', 'Hosier, who was a most extraordinary natural orator, and was admitted by the  ', '', 'bishop to be a correct theologian.  When he was preaching on the peninsula, he  ', '', 'came to Bahama manor, in the neighborhood of Esquire Bassett™s, afterwards  ', '', 'governor of Delaware, but now removed, I trust, to his heavenly rest.  One Sab- ', '', 'bath day, Esquire Basset had his church minister to dine with him, and while  ', '', 'they were at table, his servant came in, and whispered to Mrs. Basset.  The  ', '', 'Esquire asked, ﬁWhat does Joe want?ﬂ  Mrs. B. replied, ﬁHe wants to go and  ', 'hear a colored man preach.ﬂ  He turned to the clergyman, and said, ﬁA colored  ', 'man preach!  Did you ever hear of a nigger™s preaching?  Let us go.ﬂ  So he  ', '', 'told the man to bring up the carriage, and they would go and here Joe™s preacher.   ', '', 'When they came to the place, which was in the woods a few miles distant, Es- ', '', 'quire Bassett rolled a log near to the stump where the preacher stood, and they  ', '', 'sat down to hear.  The old gentleman stood up, and t', 'ook his text.  Doubtless,'], ['  Black Abolitionist Archives, Doc. No. 01975   Page 5 ', '   he was abashed at seeing all the masters in the neighborhood.  But he preached  ', '', 'his sermon.  After he was through, Esquire Basset took him by the hand, and  ', '', 'asked him, ﬁWhere were you educated?ﬂ  ﬁI have no education, sir.ﬂ  ﬁCan  ', '', 'you not read?ﬂ  ﬁNo, sir, I know only one letter in the book, and that is O.ﬂ   ', '', 'ﬁWell,ﬂ said he, ﬁI have been to colleges and seminaries, and if I were to be  ', '', 'hung for it, I could not preach such a sermon as that.ﬂ  But this is not the whole.

', '   William Lloyd Garrison has been branded as the individual who turned the  ', '', 'people of color against the colonization scheme.  But I can tell you, sir, that  ', '', 'when William Lloyd Garrison was a schoolboy, the people of color in different  ', '', 'parts of the country were holding extensive meetings, which always agreed in  ', '', 'declaring that they regarded the scheme as visionary in itself, and calculated  ', '', 'only to rivet the chains of those who remain in slavery.  I had the pleasure of  ', '', 'hearing the Hon. Charles Fenton Mercer, of Virginia, declare frankly that the  ', '', 'Colonization Society never would be able to accomplish their objects.  The Hon.  ', '', 'William S. Archer told me the same in conversation.  How far it may act bene- ', 'ficially, in abolishing the slave-trade, or in planting benevolence and civilization  ', 'in Africa, I leave for time to disclose.  But these facts show, that as to its bear- ', '', 'ings on ourselves, the people of color were not asleep.  Long before William  ', '', 'Lloyd Garrison was a man, we had fixed our ', 'veto ', 'on it.  From its very com- ', 'mencement, we had washed our hands of all connection with it. ', '', '   It is said by the pro-slavery party, that the people of color, so far as they are  ', '', 'informed on the subject, are opposed to the principles and measures of the aboli- ', '', 'tionists.  Sir, I deny it.  I know I speak the language of every intelligent man  ', '', 'of color in the United States, that has had the opportunity of understanding the  ', 'subject, when I say that we do approve of the benevolent scheme of immediate  ', 'emancipation.  There may be some at the South, who are respectable and intel- ', '', 'ligent, but who are not allowed to read for themselves the truth of the matter,  ', '', 'because it is considered treason for a colored man to read, and treason to receive  ', '', 'or give a book or a paper; and some of these may disapprove of the abolition  ', '', 'principles, because they do not understand them.  But with this exception, we'], ['    Mr. Chairman, the ladies of this Society have request- ', 'ed me to read their Annual Report; but previous to  ', '', 'complying with their desire, I would ask the liberty to  ', '', 'make a few remarks upon a subject which is considered  ', '', 'as an attribute, is one of the most prominent in the char- ', '', 'acter of God, and is daily sung by angels.

', 'GENTLEMEN:  ', '   It is with the most pleasing sensations, and feelings of high gratifi- ', 'cation, that I, in behalf of my colored fellow citizens of New York, ten- ', 'der you of delegation to this convention a hearty welcome to our  ', '', 'city.  And in behalf of the conventional board, I repeat the welcome.   ', '', 'And, gentlemen, with regard to myself, my full heart vibrates the felici- ', 'tation. ', '   You have convened to take into consideration what may be the best  ', '', 'means for the promotion of the best interest of the people of color of  ', '', 'these United States, particularly of the free people thereof. ', '   And that such convention is highly necessary, I think a few consid- ', 'erations will amply show. ', '', '   First, the present form of society divides the interest of the communi- ', '', 'ty into several parts.  Of these, there is that of the white man, that of  ', 'the slave, and that of the free colored man.  How lamentable, how very  ', 'lamentable it is that there should be, any where on earth, a community  ', '', 'of castes, with separate interests!  That society must be the most happy,  ', 'where the good of one is the common good of the whole.  Civilization  ', 'is not perfect, nor has reason full sway, until the community shall see  ', '', 'that a wrong done to one is a wrong done to the whole; that the inte- ', '', 'rest of one is or ought to be the common interest of the whole.  Surely  ', 'that must be a happy state of society where the sympathies of all are to ', 'all alike. ', '', '   How pleasing, what a compliment to the nation, is the expression of  ', '', 'Mons. Vallier a celebrated traveler in Africa, where speaking of the Hot- ', 'tentots, he says ﬁThere none need to offer themselves as objects of com- ', 'passion, for all are compassionate.ﬂ  Whatever our early-tutored preju- ', '', 'dice may say to the contrary, such a people must be happy.  Give me  ', '', 'a residence in such a society, and I shall fancy myself in a community  ', 'the most refined. ', '   But alas for the people of color in this community! their interests is not  ', '', 'identified with that of other men.  From them, white men stand aloof.   ', 'For them the eye of pity hath scarcely a tear. ', '   To them the hand of kindness is palsied, to them the dregs of mercy  ', '', 'scarcely are given.  To them the finger of scorn is pointed; contumely'], ['  and reproach is continually theirs.  They are a taunt, a hissing, and a  ', '', 'by-word.  They must cringe, and crouch, and crawl, and succumb to their  ', '', 'peers.  Long, long, long has the demon of prejudice and persecution be- ', 'set their path.  And must they make no effort to throw off the evils by  ', 'which they are beset?  Ought they not to meet to spread out their wrongs  ', '', 'before one another?  Ought they not to meet to consult on the best means  ', '', 'of relief?  Ought they not to make one weak effort; nay, one strong, one  ', 'mighty moral effort, to roll off the burden that crushes them? ', '   Under present circumstances it is highly necessary the free people of  ', '', 'color should combine, and closely attend to their own particular interest.   ', '', 'All kinds of jealousy should be swept away from among them, and their  ', 'whole eye fixed, intently fixed on their own peculiar welfare.  And can  ', 'they do better than to meet thus; to take into consideration what are the  ', '', 'best means to promote their elevation, and after having decided, to pursue  ', 'those means with unabating zeal until their end is obtained? ', '   Another reason why this convention is necessary, is, that there is form- ', '', 'ed a strong combination against the people of color, by some who are  ', '', 'the master spirits of the day, by men whose influence is of the strongest  ', 'character, to whom this nation bow in humble submission, and submit to  ', 'their superior judgment, who turn public sentiment which ever way they  ', '', 'please. ', '', '   You cannot but perceive that I allude to the Colonization Society.  How- ', 'ever pure the motives of some of the members of that society may be, yet  ', 'the master spirits thereof are evil minded towards us.  They have put on  ', '', 'the garb of angels of light.  Fold back their covering, and you have in  ', '', 'full array those of darkness. ', '   I need not spread before you the proofs of their evil purposes.  Of  ', 'that you have had a quantity sufficient; and were there no other good  ', '', 'reason for this convention, the bare circumstance of the existence of such  ', '', 'an institution would be a sufficient one.  I do hope, confidently hope, that  ', 'the time will arrive, and is near at hand, when we shall be in full posses- ', 'sion of all the rights of men. ', '', '   But as long at least as the Colonization Society exists, will a convention  ', 'of colored people be highly necessary.  This society is the great Dagon  ', 'of the land, before whom the people bow and cry, Great Jehovah, and to'], ['  whom they would sacrifice the free people of color.  That society has  ', '', 'spread itself over this whole land, it is artful, it suits itself to all places.  ', '', 'It is one thing at the south, and another at the north; it blows hot and  ', 'cold; it sends forth bitter and sweet; it sometimes represents us as the  ', 'most corrupt, vicious, and abandoned of any class of men in the commu- ', '', 'nity.  Then again we are kind, meek, and gentle.  Here we are ignor- ', '', 'ant, idle, and nuisance, and a drawback on the resources of the country.   ', 'But as abandoned as we are, in Africa we shall civilize and christianize  ', 'all that heathen country. ', '', '   And by thus preaching continually, they have distilled into the minds  ', '', 'of the community a desire to see us removed. ', '   They have resorted to every artifice to effect their purposes. ', '   By exciting in the minds of the white community the fears of insur- ', '', 'rection and amalgamation; ', '   By petitioning state legislatures to grant us no favors; ', '   By petitioning congress to aid in sending us away; ', '', '   By using their influence to prevent the establishment of seminaries  ', '', 'for our instruction in the higher branches of education. ', '   And such are the men of that society that the community are blind to  ', 'their absurdities, contradictions, and paradoxes.  They are well acquaint- ', '', 'ed with the ground and the wiles by which to beguile the people. ', '', '   It is therefore highly necessary we should meet, in order that we may  ', 'confer on the best means to frustrate the purpose of so awful a foe. ', '   I would beg leave to recommend an attentive consideration to this  ', '', 'matter.  Already you have done much toward the enervation of this gi- ', '', 'ant: he begins to grow feeble; indeed he seems to be making his last  ', 'struggle, if we may judge from his recent movements.  Hang around  ', 'him; assail him quickly.  He is vulnerable.  Well pointed darts will  ', '', 'fetch him down, and soon he breathes no more. ', '', '   Cheer up, my friends!  Already has your protest against the Coloniza- ', 'tion Society shown to the world that the people of color are not willing  ', 'to be expatriated.  Cheer up.

Anti-Slavery Societies  ', '', 'are forming in every direction. ', '', '   Next August proclaims the British dominions free from slaves. ', '   These United states are her children, they will soon follow so good an  ', 'example.  Slavery, that Satanic monster, that beast whose mark has been  ', '', 'so long stamped on the forehead of the nations, shall be chained and cast  ', '', 'down into blackness and darkness forever. ', '   Soon, my brethren, shall the judgment be set.  Then shall rise in glory  ', 'and triumph, reason, virtue, kindness and liberty, and take a high exalt- ', '', 'ed stand among the sons of men.  Then shall tyranny, cruelty, prejudice  ', 'and slavery be cast down to the lowest depths of oblivion; yea, be ban- ', 'ished from the presence of God, and the glory of his power forever.  Oh  ', '', 'blessed consummation, and devoutly to be desired! ', '', '   It is for you, my brethren, to help on in this work of moral improve- ', 'ment.  Man is capable of high advances in his reasoning and moral  ', 'faculties.  Man is in the pursuit of happiness.  And reason, or experi- ', '', 'ence, which is the parent of reason, tells us that the highest state of mo- ', '', 'rality is the highest state of happiness.  Aside from a future day of judg- ', 'ment and retribution, there is always a day of retribution at hand.  That  ', 'society is most miserable that is most immoral ', ' that most happy that is  ', 'most virtuous.  Let me therefore recommend earnestly that you press  ', 'upon our people the necessity and advantage of a moral reformation.  It  ', '', 'may not produce an excess of riches, but it will produce a higher state  ', 'of happiness, and render our circumstances easier. ', '   You, gentlemen, can begin here.  By managing this conference in a  ', '', 'spirit of good will and true politeness; by constantly keeping in view  ', '', 'and cultivating a spirit of peace, order and harmony, rather than satire,  ', 'wit, and eloquence; by putting the best possible construction on each  ', 'other™s language, rather than charging each other with improper motives.'], ['  These dispositions will bespeak our character more or less virtuous  ', '', 'and refined, and render our sitting more or less pleasant.  I will only  ', '', 'now add, that the report of the conventional board will be submitted at  ', 'your call; and my earnest hope is that you may have a peaceful, pleasant  ', 'sitting.'], ['    Mr. ANDREW HARRIS, of Philadelphia, a gentleman of  ', 'color, was introduced by the President as a graduate of the  ', '', 'University of Vermont.  He spoke with much freedom and  ', '', 'force, in support of a resolution, That the degradation and  ', '', 'crime charged upon the free colored population in this coun- ', 'try, is the result of the wrongs under which they suffer.   ', '   It is with no pleasant feelings, said he, that I stand here  ', '', 'to speak in relation to the wrongs of a portion of the inhabi- ', '', 'tants of this country, who, by their complexion, are identifi- ', '', 'ed with myself.  It is with feelings of great responsibility  ', '', 'that I stand here as their representative. ', '', '   Who of our Pilgrim fathers, when they entered ship, and  ', 'committed themselves to the waves ', ' when the breeze car- ', 'ried back the echo of their songs, ever thought the day  ', 'would come, when an assembly like this would meet on the  ', '', 'island of Manhattan, for such an object?  Who would then  ', '', 'have supposed, that the oppression and wrongs of millions  ', '', 'in this country, would have been so great as to call together  ', '', 'an audience like this?  If an inhabitant of another world  ', '', 'should enter one of these doors, and look abroad upon these  ', 'thousands, and ask, ‚For what are you assembled?™ and the  ', 'voice of this multitude should be heard in answer, ‚We  ', '', 'have come here to hear and converse about the wrongs of  ', '', 'our fellow men;™ would he esteem it a light or trifling  ', '', 'thing, which has brought this audience together? ', '   But from whence spring these wrongs? ', ' the original  ', 'source from which they spring, is the corruption of the hu- ', 'man heart.  The beginning of its development is ', 'slavery', '.   Shall I again point to the South, and depict the sufferings of  ', 'the slave?  If the groans and sighs of the victims of slave[-] ', '', 'ry could be collected, and thrown out here in one volley,  ', '', 'these walls would tremble, these pillars would be removed  ', 'from their foundations, and we should find ourselves buried'], ['   in the ruins of the edifice.  If the blood of the innocent,  ', '', 'which has been shed by slavery, could be poured out here,  ', 'this audience might swim in it, ', ' or if they could not swim  ', 'they would be drowned.  If the tears that slavery has caus- ', 'ed to be shed, were poured out here, there might be a sea  ', '', 'on which to ply the oar in exercise of sport and diversion.   ', 'But this is not all ', ' the anguish produced by the separation  ', 'of husband and wife, children and parents, and the scourges  ', 'of the defenceless and unoffending slave, are a fathomless  ', '', 'sea, and an ocean without a shore.   ', '', '   But slavery does not stop here.  It presses down upon  ', '', 'the free people of color.  Its deadly poison is disseminated  ', '', 'from the torrid regions of the South to the frigid North.   ', '', 'We feel it here.  Yet, with all this, if the colored man is  ', '', 'vicious, or if he is not elevated, it is set down to his natural  ', '', 'stupidity and depravity, and the argument is raised that he  ', 'belongs to an inferior race.  The colored people are also  ', 'charged with want of desire for education and improvement;  ', '', 'yet, if a colored man comes to the door of our institutions  ', '', 'of learning, with desires ever so strong, the lords of these  ', '', 'institutions rise up and shut the door; and then you say we  ', '', 'have not the desire nor the ability to acquire education.   ', '', 'Thus, while the white youth enjoy all these advantages, we  ', '', 'are excluded and shut out, and must remain ignorant.  It is  ', '', 'natural to suppose, then, that there should be more crime  ', 'among us.  But is this crime properly chargeable to the  ', 'colored man, as evidence of the vicious propensities of his  ', '', 'race? ', '', '   Again, in the social relations of life, wrongs are inflicted  ', '', 'upon us that are grievous and heavy to be borne, and we  ', '', 'must fold our arms and bear it.  But even this is thrown  ', '', 'out as a taunt against us, that we do not speak of our wrongs,'], ['   as evidence that we are too stupid and degraded to feel them:  ', '', 'while, if we rise to defend ourselves, and to plead our cause,  ', '', 'the torch and the brick-bat are poured out as arguments on  ', '', 'the other side.  As a specimen, I will mention what I ex- ', 'perienced in my passage to this city, from the city of  ', 'ﬁbrotherly love,ﬂ so called; but as to the claim it has upon  ', '', 'that title, I leave the ruins of Pennsylvania Hall to answer.   ', '', 'On the way, they refused to give the colored man a seat, but  ', '', 'put him up in boxes, as they would monkeys or wild geese.   ', '', 'And why was this? was it because he had no money?  No.   ', '', 'Was it because he was not decently clad?  No.  Was it  ', '', 'because he was an idiot, and they feared he would annoy  ', 'the company with his foolishness?  No ', ' it is because he has  ', 'the complexion which God has given him.', '   The bible says  ', 'the love of money is the root of all evil; and if the love of  ', '', 'money is a predominant passion anywhere, it is in this land.   ', '', 'Yet, without disputing the correctness of the declaration,  ', '', 'it seems to me that slavery has developed a passion in the  ', '', 'human heart that is stronger than the love of money; for  ', 'they refuse to gratify this disposition which the bible says  ', 'is the root of all evil, through the influence of that still  ', '', 'deeper root of evil, ', 'prejudice', '.    Again: the colored man is deprived of the opportunity of  ', '', 'obtaining those situations in society which his enemies say  ', '', 'he ought to hold, if capable.  If he wishes to be useful as a  ', '', 'professional man, a merchant or a mechanic, he is prevented  ', '', 'by the color of his skin, and driven to those menial employ- ', '', 'ments which tend to bring us more and more into disrepute.  ', '   The church itself was not free from participation in the  ', 'general guilt of oppressing the black man.  He feared that  ', '', 'some her pastors would in the great day, have the Judge  ', '', 'say to them, though ye have cast out devils in my name, yet  ', '', 'this devil of prejudice you have not cast out of your own'], ['   hearts ', ' and though you may have done many wonderful  ', 'works, one great work, that of emancipating the slave, ye  ', 'have left undone.   ', '', '   Time would fail me, said he, to depict all these wrongs.   ', '', 'Yet, with all the oppression and odium that is heaped upon  ', '', 'us here, I for one would rather stand and endure it all,  ', '', 'choosing rather to suffer affliction with my people, than to  ', '', 'emigrate to a foreign shore, though I might there enjoy the  ', '', 'pleasures of Egypt.  And while I live, let my prayer be,  ', '', 'that the same soil which cherished my father may cherish  ', 'me; and when I die, that the same dust may cover me that  ', 'covered the ashes of my father.'], ['    Mr. HILTON followed, though he would gladly have ', 'been excused, having come entirely unprepared.  He  ', '', 'would, however, yield, he said, to the request of the  ', '', 'chair, though the gentlemen who had preceded him  ', '', 'had given them the meat and he should find nothing  ', '', 'to offer but the fragments.  He dared not thus, on the  ', '', 'spur of the moment, give the audience in whose eyes  ', '', 'he saw such interest and expectation, the workings of  ', 'his own brain, but would rapidly glance over the his- ', 'tory of the years that preceded the passage of the  ', '', 'Emancipation Act.  He then gave a condensed view  ', '', 'of the workings of the spirit of abolition, from the  ', '', 'commencement of the enterprise by Clarkson, to its  ', '', 'consummation.  He alluded in a very feeling manner,  ', '', 'to the friend owing to whose absence it was that he  ', '', 'had been called upon to speak, who would have told  ', '', 'them in words of eloquence to which he (Mr. H.)  ', 'could not pretend, of the workings of emancipation  ', 'in the enfranchised islands.  He then proceeded to  ', '', 'give an animated sketch, accompanied by the authen- ', '', 'ticated statistics, of the empty jails, the rusty tread- ', '', 'mills, the orderly population, since the abolition of  ', '', 'the apprenticeship.  He directed the attention of the  ', '', 'audience to the fact that prejudice and slavery were  ', '', 'constant companions, and that emancipation removed  ', '', 'the former, and opened the way of civil preferment to  ', 'the man of color; concluding with thanks to God for  ', 'the signal refutation of the pro-slavery slanders upon  ', '', 'the man of color, which West India emancipation  ', '', 'had afforded.'], [' MY WELL-BELOVED FRIEND AND BROTHER: ', '   Ten years have well-nigh elapsed, since it was my  ', '', 'happy lot, in conjunction with the chairman of this  ', '', 'meeting, to greet your first entrance into the city of  ', '', 'Boston, and to give you a hearty welcome, as our or- ', '', 'ganŠas an exponent of the feelings of the colored  ', '', 'people.

', 'In the death of HENRY SIPKINS our community has ', 'sustained a public loss, and the society with whom  ', 'he was connected, a useful and valuable member,  ', '', 'one of its brightest ornaments, one that will ever be  ', '', 'remembered with respect down to the latest pos- ', '', 'terity. ', '', '   In presenting myself before you, I am aware of  ', '', 'the position in which I have placed myself; but  ', '', 'from a disposition to use my humble efforts in con- ', '', 'dolence for departed merit, I set diffidence aside to  ', 'perform the solemn task.  And when I reflect that  ', 'the companions of my youth, those with whom I  ', '', 'have so often consulted for the improvement of our  ', '', 'people, are falling as the autumnal leaves, I feel  ', '', 'constrained to offer a few remarks in their behalf.   ', '', '   Our beloved brother was born on the 15', 'th day of  ', 'November, 1788, and died on the 30', 'th of Septem- ', 'ber, 1838, in the 50', 'th year of his age.  He was the  ', 'oldest son of the late Thomas Sipkins of this city,  ', 'an honorable and worthy member of society, who  ', 'was ever ready to help the oppressed and soften the  ', '', 'bed of affliction, to dry up the widow™s tear and as- ', '', 'sist the orphan.  In him the religion of our Lord  ', '', 'and Savior found one of its firmest and most con- ', 'sistent advocates ', ' he was an honest man, honesty  ', 'was his ruling passion, he was one of the noblest  ', 'workmanship of his Creator; and his son was pos- ', '', 'sessed of like virtues, with one exception, he was  ', '', 'not a member of any church.'], ['     At an early age he received the first rudiments  ', '', 'of an English education, which he studiously im- ', '', 'proved until the day of his demise, which he was  ', '', 'ever ready to use for the benefit of his people in  ', '', 'every laudable enterprize.  From the age of twenty  ', '', 'one, he was identified with almost every enterprize  ', '', 'having for its object the elevation of his oppressed  ', 'brethren and the rising generation.  He was one  ', 'of those who remonstrated against the State Con- ', '', 'vention, in 1821, on the revision of the Constitu- ', '', 'tion, and the injustice of depriving citizens of color  ', '', 'of the elective franchise, which subject caused that ', '', 'body of men, composed of the best talent in the  ', '', 'State, to deliberate for the space of twelve days, and  ', '', 'thereby secured to us the right of suffrage with cer- ', 'tain restrictions ', ' he was also one of that body  ', 'whose exertions caused the great change which  ', 'we experience in the education of our children by  ', '', 'our people, which before was denied us, but was re- ', '', 'served for individuals of a favored class, the good ', '', 'result of which is apparent to all.  Mr. Sipkins  ', '', 'was one of the first delegates to the convention of  ', 'the people of color from this city.  He was Vice  ', 'President of the Political Association now in ope- ', '', 'ration.  He was not one who lived only for him- ', 'self ', '    ﬁWhat then am I who sorrow for myself, ', '   In age, in infancy, from others aid ', '   Is all our hope to teach us to be kind; ', '   That Nature™s first last lesson to mankind ', '    The selfish heart deserves the pain it feels.ﬂ'], ['    Mr. Sipkins raised his voice with others against  ', 'the injustice of the sons of avarice, until this whole  ', '', 'nation has become convulsed on the subject of their  ', '', 'oppressed brethren.  It may be necessary for me to  ', '', 'state how and in what manner this important work  ', '', 'has been brought about, for it may be that some one  ', '', 'may not conceive how this could possibly be effect- ', '', 'ed.  In order to be fairly understood I will explain.   ', 'It was first commenced with feeble efforts ', ' but like  ', 'the stately oak which receives its first growth from  ', 'the acorn, extends its branches, so have their labors  ', 'been blessed ', ' their first attempt was to raise an  ', 'Improvement Society, which failed.  Secondly, an  ', 'abortive one, to establish a Mechanics Society; but  ', '', 'finally the Mutual Relief Society was instituted,  ', 'which has stood the test of the last thirty years ', '  here the names of our venerable brethren, Messrs.  ', 'John Teasman, William Hamilton, Sen., Henry  ', 'Sipkins and others, which delicacy at present pre- ', '', 'vents me from naming, stands forth in bold relief,  ', '', 'and are worthy to be recorded on tablets of adamant,  ', '', 'in letters of gold, and handed down to the latest  ', '', 'posterity.  This was the first incorporated benevo- ', '', 'lent society in this state, and I believe in the United  ', '', 'States.  Mr. Sipkins was its first Secretary, and ', '', 'Filled all the various offices in the society from time ', 'to time with honor to himself and satisfaction to ', 'His fellow members.  After the successful opera- ', '', 'tion of the Mutual Relief, our people, who were ', '', 'indifferent in their degradation, became animated  ', '', 'and consolidated among themselves, and the result  ', '', 'has been visible.  Society after society has been  ', '', 'formed and still are forming, both male and fe-'], ['  male.  Addresses were delivered, depicting the cruel- ', '', 'ty and the wrongs to which we were subjected.  At  ', '', 'that time it would, with distrust, be credited that a  ', '', 'person of color wrote an address; but our detract- ', '', 'ors were in a very short time convinced of their  ', '', 'error.  By being thus consolidated, they were pre- ', '', 'pared for action; and when that hydra-headed mon- ', 'ster the colonization society, with its argus eyes,  ', 'reared its head, our departed advocate with his col- ', '', 'leagues sounded the alarm, and advised our people  ', '', 'to remonstrate, it possible, from Maine to Georgia.   ', '', 'They responded to the call, and our voice was heard  ', '', 'until our Garrison had sufficient to form a volume  ', '', 'which has told our tale of woe to the civilized  ', '', 'world, and exposed the iniquity of that institution  ', '', 'of prejudice and deception.  Even a Wilberforce,  ', 'that philanthropist who spent a life in the cause of  ', 'oppressed humanity, whose keen discernment baf- ', '', 'fled the enemies of emancipation in the British par- ', '', 'liament, for nearly half a century, was led to be- ', '', 'lieve it an institution of benevolence, by the misre- ', '', 'presentations of their agents in England until our  ', '', 'beloved William Llord Garrison unfolded to him  ', '', 'his Thoughts on Colonization, embodying our re- ', '', 'monstrances, which at once exposed this wicked de- ', 'ception ', ' and the last public act of his life was to  ', 'sign his protest against it.  Our beloved brother,  ', 'whose mind was ever on the alert in behalf of his  ', '', 'oppressed countrymen, conceived the idea of passing  ', '', 'resolutions, and presenting a vote of approbation to  ', '', 'the Hon. Daniel O™Connel; and at the same time'], ['   he gave his services and made use of all his influ- ', '', 'ence to gain admission to as many of the daily pa- ', '', 'pers in this city as possible, thereby hoping to elicit  ', '', 'friends to our cause.  He also addressed a private  ', '', 'letter to him on the subject of our population, which  ', '', 'I believe had the desired effect.  I know he received  ', '', 'them.  And when it was considered expedient that  ', 'a Convention should be convened, he took a very  ', 'active part, acting as president, &c. at various times  ', '', 'to the entire satisfaction of his constituents.  The  ', '', 'Convention called forth such men as Lundy, Gar- ', '', 'rison, Tappan, Jocelyn, and others; there they  ', '', 'confronted the champions of colonization, man to  ', '', 'man, and my friends, I am firmly of the opinion,  ', '', 'that most of the important movements in our be- ', '', 'half, may be traced to these preliminary steps  ', 'which has been promulgated by our departed friends.   ', 'With a view that his sentiments may be more gen- ', '', 'erally known, a few extracts from his last address  ', '', 'which was adopted by the Convention of 1833, I  ', 'think will satisfy every candid mind ', ' they are as  ', 'follows: ', '   ﬁBrethren and Fellow Citizens ', ' It is a matter  ', 'of high congratulation that, through the providence  ', 'of Almighty God, we have been enabled to convene,  ', '', 'for the fourth time, as the representatives of the  ', '', 'free people of color of eight of the States of the Un- ', '', 'ion, for the purpose of devising plans for the mutu- ', 'al and common improvement, in this, the land of  ', 'our nativity. ', '', '   To that important object the entire attention of'], ['   the convention has been directed; but to effect it,  ', '', 'as might be expected, a very considerable diversity  ', '', 'of sentiment as to the best means, existed.  Various  ', '', 'circumstances growing out of our local situations  ', '', 'operate to produce a great difference of feeling, as  ', '', 'well as of judgment, in the course best calculated to  ', '', 'insure our advancement in prosperity.  Our breth- ', 'ren at the south are subject to many very cruel and  ', 'oppressive laws, to get clear of which they will  ', '', 'consent to go into exile, as promising to them en- ', '', 'joyments from which they are cut off in the land of  ', '', 'their birth.  Gratitude to the bountiful Bestower of  ', '', 'all good, compels us to rejoice in the acknowledg- ', '', 'ement that the lot of many of us has fallen in a hap- ', '', 'pier and fairer portion of the land, to separate our- ', '', 'selves from which, or to promulgate a wish to do  ', 'so, without better prospects of improvement before  ', 'us than has yet come to our knowledge, would be  ', '', 'suicidal to the vital interests of the colored people  ', '', 'of the free states, and would justly draw down upon  ', '', 'us the execration of the thinking part in the slave  ', '', 'states.

At length, the'], ['  time for emancipation had arrived.  The mind of the  ', 'whole country, peer, priest and peasant, was wrought  ', '', 'up.

', '   Yesterday our citizens and neighbors, who are of  ', 'a different cast from us, did with propriety hoist the  ', '', 'star-spangled banner and watered the tree planted  ', '', 'for them by their fathers fifty-six years ago, when the  ', '', 'noise of the drum, the thundering of the cannon, the  ', '', 'toasts of the people, all united in forming strong ex- ', 'pressions of their joy and tokens of their union; ', '  while we the descendants of Africa, for no al- ', 'leged crime by us or our forefathers committed,  ', '', 'are despised, rejected and excluded from all the  ', '', 'privileges calculated to render the life of man com- ', '', 'fortable.  We are denied the privilege of filling a  ', '', 'station in social, political or religious society on  ', '', 'terms of equality, amongst a people who differ from  ', 'us in their complexion! Yea, more ', ' we are de- ', 'prived measurably of the means of grace, which are  ', 'calculated to prepare us for the kingdom of glory.   ', '', 'The doors of the schools are barred against us by a  ', '', 'legislative act, and that too contrary to the legisla- ', '', 'tion of heaven; for we are commanded to train our  ', '', 'children in the way they should go.  This is a hard  ', 'task for us or any other people, so long as the means  ', 'of training are withheld.  It needs no argument to  ', '', 'confirm this fact.  Only let us look to the history of  ', '', 'nations, and there we shall see that all people des- ', '', 'titute of the revealed will of God, have been envel-'], [' oped in ignorance, moral gloom and superstition, ', '', 'and possessing a spirit of insubordination.  And  ', '', 'such, fellow-citizens, has been our unhappy fate: ', '', 'and if ever there have been a people on earth, whose  ', 'situation and interest called for a combination, it is  ', 'meliorate our condition? not, what can be done by  ', '', 'others? ', 'Let every one of us cherish a friendly union with  ', 'ourselves; and in order to do this, let the members  ', '', 'of our churches be true to their God, and then they  ', 'will be true to each other ', ' and the non-professing  ', 'part of our race will, in some degree, follow our ex- ', 'ample.  Let christians throw away the spirit of su- ', '', 'periority, and acknowledge every human being their  ', '', 'brother and equal, as it respects his creation; for it  ', '', 'has been the vain and unfounded notion of superior- ', '', 'ity, as it respects our creation, which this day, my  ', '', 'fellow-citizens, excludes us from a friendly and so- ', '', 'cial intercourse on terms of equality with those of  ', 'our neighbors who differ from us in complexion.   ', 'This day causes millions of our sable race to groan  ', '', 'under the galling yoke of bondage.  Let us, then,  ', '', 'respect each other according to character and mer- ', '', 'it; and then, and not till then, shall we know what  ', '', 'it is to enjoy the comforts of social society. ', '', '   Permit me, fellow-citizens, in the sequel of my  ', '', 'address, to confine myself more particularly to the  ', '', 'colored people of our own town and neighborhood.   ', 'Twenty years ago, individual attempts were made  ', 'to benefit the condition of colored individuals in this  ', '', 'place; but little general good resulted therefrom.   ', '', 'Ten years ago, it entered the hearts of some of our  ', '', 'worthy colored citizens, whose names ought to be'], [' handed down to our latest posterity, to form a com- ', '', 'bination to remove the moral gloom, and ameliorate  ', '', 'the condition of our rising race, which combination  ', '', 'was entered into, and the good effect has been seen  ', 'by every strict observer in our town, both white and  ', 'colored.  Two churches have since been erected by  ', 'the people of color ', ' one Baptist ', ' the other Metho- ', 'dist ', ' both of which are attended by colored persons  ', 'of respectability.  Our children have been called  ', 'from wandering in the streets, and some of our adult  ', '', 'profligates called from scenes of debauchery and  ', '', 'vice to experience the love of God.  Our school has  ', '', 'been successfully taught for the last eight years.   ', '', 'Many of our children have been educated, enlight- ', '', 'ened and raised to respectability. ', '', ' This combination endeared neighbor to neighbor,  ', 'family to family, and children to children, until the  ', 'whole mass of the respectable part of the people of  ', '', 'color in our town formed one general compact, and  ', '', 'became more powerful in doing good than the Phil- ', '', 'istine giant who defied the armies of the living God. ', '', '   Away with prejudice and the slanderous assertion  ', '', 'that imbecility of the Africans renders them in- ', '', 'capable of improvement.  Let those who accuse us  ', '', 'of inferiority, as it respects our intellect and struc- ', 'ture, look through the dark vista of past ages, and  ', 'read in the history of Hannibal and others, who  ', '', 'were Africans, the strength of intellect, the sound- ', '', 'ness of judgement, the military skill, which existed in ', '', 'ancient Africa.  Africa was the garden and nursery  ', '', 'where learning budded and education sprang.  From  ', '', 'Egypt the arts of civilization were carried into  ', '', 'Greece, and from Greece to Europe: therefore all'], [' the now civilized world is indebted to sable Africa  ', '', 'for the arts of civilization and learning.  If our an- ', '', 'cestors were instructed and became great on the  ', '', 'burning shores of Afric, why may not their descend- ', 'ants, in a milder clime, even on the continent of  ', 'America?  It is not essential that three millions of  ', '', '[t]he sable sons and daughters of Africa must be sent  ', '', 'to Liberia before they can be enlightened and be- ', 'come respectable ', ' it can be done at home: and if  ', 'our neighbors and lawgivers could be induced, by  ', 'our entreaties, supplications and groans, to remove  ', 'our heavy burthens, and afford us the means of im- ', '', 'provement, the confined African would leap from  ', '', 'his chains, and stand forth with the enlightened men  ', '', 'of the earth.   ', '', '   I can say in justice to the honor and credit of my  ', '', 'colored citizens of Chillicothe, that this place is the  ', '', 'mother and guardian of literature to the colored peo- ', '', 'ple west of the Alleghany mountains.  With us the  ', 'spark kindled and burnt till our brethren in neigh- ', 'boring towns caught the flame, and set their hands  ', '', 'to the great work of reform; and if we continue our  ', '', 'efforts with firm steps and unwearied zeal, guided  ', '', 'by an all-wise Ruler, we shall soon be able to stretch  ', '', 'our hands across an ocean of three or four thousand  ', '', 'miles, and there unite with our sable brethren in  ', '', 'cultivating friendship and good feelings, till the  ', '', 'whole of our race become enlightened and each one  ', 'say, ‚Let me seek my neighbor™s good.™ ', '   Suffer me, fellow-citizens, to give a short state- ', '', 'ment of things at this time among us.  For the last  ', '', 'two years a spirit of contention and division has en- ', '', 'tered among us.

Let this maxim be engraven on  ', 'our memories: UNITED, WE STAND ', ' DIVIDED,  ', 'WE FALL.'], ['    ‚GENTLEMEN: ', ' I am truly sensible of the ho- ', 'nor you have conferred on me, on this momentous ', 'occasion, and I assure you that I feel more than an ', '', 'ordinary solicitude to discharge with honor and pro- ', '', 'priety, the duties devolving on me.

This  ', '', 'Society has been in existence, I believe, for about seven- ', '', 'teen years; and at the moment it was organized, the co- ', 'loured people came forward in a body, and said to the So- ', 'ciety, ', ' ﬁWe do not wish to go to Africa; we consider  ', 'this as our home, as the land of our nativity.ﬂ  But it has  ', 'been objected, that it was not the home of coloured  ', '', 'man; on the contrary, that Africa was his home, and  ', '', 'America is the home of the white man.  But we have asked  ', 'our opponents, those who [have] thought fit to make the  ', 'assertion, What is it that has given to the white man a  ', '', 'prior claim to the soil? (Cheers.)  Was it because they  ', '', 'went to the United States of America, and, instead of in- ', '', 'culcating the pure principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ,  ', '', 'they exerted their influence and the physical power in  ', '', 'destroying the original inhabitants of the country?  Was  ', '', 'it because they found that they could not reduce the In- ', '', 'dians to a state of servile bondage, and therefore almost  ', 'exterminated them, and reduced them to a mere remnant?   ', 'Has this given them prior claim?  If it has, we submit  ', '', 'to them, and we say that they are entitled to credit for  ', '', 'what they have done, and for what they are still striving  ', '', 'to do, namely, to persecute and to drive them beyond the'], ['  Mississippi.  (Hear, hear, and cries of shame!)  But if  ', '', 'they contend that the struggle, during the revolution  ', '', 'which separated that country from this, ha[s] given them a  ', '', 'prior claim, we deny that claim, because in that struggle  ', '(Oh, be it remembered!) complexion was entirely out of  ', 'the question (cheers); the black man was then considered  ', 'as good as the white.  We were all brethren ', ' we were all  ', 'kindred ', ' we were bone of each other™s bone, and flesh of  ', 'each other™s flesh.  I may mention, in connection with  ', 'this fact, that my father, who has now gone to a better  ', '', 'world, shouldered his musket, went into the field of bat- ', '', 'tle, and contended for the liberties of that country which  ', '', 'the whites are now enjoying.  (Applause.)  He was not  ', '', 'the only individual: but the coloured people generally  ', '', 'went forth to the combat.  They felt that their interests  ', '', 'were identified with those of the people generally, and  ', 'they thought that they were fighting for the liberties of  ', 'themselves and of their children.  As, then, it was not  ', '', 'the circumstance of the revolution, not the effects of it,  ', '', 'which have given to them a prior claim, I hold that I have  ', '', 'as good a right to that country as any white man, what- ', '', 'ever may be said to the reverse.  (Cheers.)  I care not  ', '', 'about their declarations to the contrary, it is my coun- ', '', 'try; it is the land that gave me birth[;] and I have as good  ', '', 'a right to it as any other individual.  In saying this, I only  ', 'speak the sentiments of the people of colour generally, ', 'throughout that country.  They all imbibe the same sen- ', '', 'timents, and they say to their white brethren, ﬁWhy is  ', '', 'it that you wish to expel us, while you throw open the  ', '', 'door to European emigrants?  You say to the English,  ', '', 'the Scotch, the Irish, and the French, ‚Come here; here  ', '', 'is liberty; here you may enjoy all the blessings which we,  ', '', 'as a nation, enjoy.™ﬂ  But the coloured people must be'], ['  expelled; and there is no reason that can be assigned for  ', '', 'it, but the prejudice, the unhallowed prejudice, that rests  ', '', 'in the bosom of the white man against his sable breth- ', '', 'ren.  (Hear, hear.)  The ground that we have taken, in  ', 'relation to our expulsion from that country, is simply  ', 'this: ', ' We say, in the first place, What have we done?   ', 'Why must we go to Africa?  Have we ever manifested  ', 'any disposition to insubordination?  Have we ever been  ', '', 'your enemies in times of war, or have we stirred up in- ', '', 'surrection?  Have we, as a people, been guilty of any  ', 'misdemeanour, or any crime?  The reply is in the ne- ', 'gative, and the only affirmative is, ﬁYou are black men.ﬂ   ', '', '(Hear.)  Here is the principle of prejudice that operates  ', '', 'against us.  We ask, then, What is this prejudice?  Is it  ', '', 'a virtue?  If it be a virtue, it ought to be cherished.  Or,  ', '', 'is it a vice?  If it be a vice, we call upon you to raise  ', '', 'your voice against it, and endeavour to expel it as you  ', '', 'would any other vice.  (Hear, hear, and applause.)  But,  ', '', 'instead of aiming at the removal of that prejudice, they  ', 'direct their efforts against us who are its objects, and we  ', 'must be expelled from the country.  I have watched the  ', '', 'progress of the Colonization Society from its commence- ', '', 'ment; and, as my worthy friend (Mr. Garrison) has well  ', '', 'stated, it has been the means of increasing that prejudice  ', '', 'which before was sufficiently strong against the coloured  ', '', 'people.   What can we think, when statesmen, and even  ', '', 'ministers of the Gospel (and which I have heard myself),  ', 'in pleading on behalf of the Colonizat[i]on Society, say, ', '  ﬁThe free people of colour are a curse in this country,  ', 'and if you do not expel them, the time will come when  ', 'they will associate with the slaves ', ' will rise ', 'en masse', ', and   ', 'cut the throats of all the white inhabitants of this coun- ', 'try.  It is, therefore, necessary to expel them.ﬂ  Well,'], ['  now, these sentiments, uttered by the leading men, and  ', '', 'coming from the ministers of the Gospel, must exert an  ', '', 'influence upon the community at large; and hence they  ', '', 'have a tendency to lead them to think that, unless they  ', 'co-operate with the Colonization Society, and remove the  ', 'free people of colour, either themselves or their children  ', '', 'will be massacred by us.  But we have taken every means  ', '', 'we possibly could to convince the members of the Coloni- ', '', 'zation Society, that it was not our desire or our intention  ', '', 'to go to Africa.  How have we expressed it?  Why, there  ', '', 'is no town in the United States of America, where they  ', '', 'have had liberty of speech and liberty of assembling toge- ', '', 'ther, in which they have not passed the most decided re- ', 'solutions against this Society.  This is not all; but they  ', 'have held state conventions, in order that there might be  ', '', 'union among the people in regard to this question, and the  ', '', 'state conventions have expressed the same sentiments.   ', '', 'But even this is not all; they have held a United States  ', '', 'convention (that is, a meeting of delegates from every  ', '', 'State where they have the liberty of holding a convention)  ', '', 'in Philadelphia, and this has expressed and reiterated the  ', '', 'same sentiment.  We have said to them, ﬁLet us  ', 'alone.ﬂ', ' [Mr. ', 'GARRISON', ' here interrupted, and said, I will read  ', 'the resolution passed by that Convention in 1832.  They ', 'are holding another Session at this time.  It is this: ', '  ﬁResolved, That we still solemnly and sincerely protest ', 'against any interference; on the part of the American ', '', 'Colonization Society, with the free coloured population ', '', 'of the United States, so long as they shall countenance or ', '', 'endeavour to use coercive measures (either directly or in- ', '', 'directly) to colonize us in any place which is not the ob- ', '', 'ject of our choice.  And we ask them respectfully, as men'], ['  and as Christians, to cease their unhallowed persecutions ', '', 'of a people already sufficiently oppressed; or if, as they ', '', 'profess, they have our welfare and prosperity at heart, to  ', '', 'assist us in the object of our choice.  Our views and sen- ', 'timents have long since gone to the world ', ' the wings of ', 'the wind have borne our disapprobation of that institu- ', 'tion.  Time itself cannot erase it.  We have dated our ', '', 'opposition from its beginning, and our views are stength- ', '', 'ened by time and circumstances.ﬂ] ', '  The Rev. ', 'N. PAUL', ' resumed. ', ' I will only add one word  ', 'more, before I sit down, and it is this,-the Colonization  ', 'Society, considered in itself, we so not so much fear.   ', '', 'Although it is exerting an influence against us, yet still,  ', '', 'as a Society merely, it possesses no power; it cannot ab- ', '', 'solutely compel us to go to Africa.  But what, we have  ', '', 'ever been afraid of is this (and according to what has  ', 'taken place in various parts of the country, our conclu- ', 'sions are but too well founded), ', ' that it will ultimately  ', 'arrive to this point, that measures will be taken by the  ', 'Government to compel us to go, whether we are willing or  ', '', 'not.  (Hear, hear.)  The legislatures of several States have  ', '', 'expressed their approbation of the objects of the Society.   ', 'The Institution has likewise memorialized the Govern- ', 'ment of the United States, and has endeavoured to obtain  ', '', 'its approbation to help on the efforts.  The point to  ', '', 'which we are looking is, that if they go on, and succeed  ', '', 'in the efforts they are making, we doubt not but that they  ', '', 'will ultimately obtain an appropriation of certain sums of  ', '', 'money for the removal of the free people of colour to  ', '', 'Africa.  What will follow?  If the Government should  ', '', 'give money for this purpose, and if there be not a sufficient  ', 'number of persons found willing to go, coercive means  ', 'and measures will be adopted by Government to compel'], ['    The Rev. N. PAUL then came forward and ', 'saidŠ ', '   In rising to address an audience of this de- ', '', 'scription, I shall not offer an apology, because  ', '', 'I consider it to be unnecessary.

', '(Cheers.) ', '', '   I make no complaint against the agent of  ', '', 'the American Colonization Society for stating  ', '', 'the fact that Mr. Garrison was convicted, and  ', '', 'thrown into prison in the United States; it is  ', '', 'a fact, and he had a right to the advantage of  ', '', 'it whenever he saw fit.

I answer, in the first  ', 'place, because it undertakes to expel from  ', '', 'their native country hundreds of thousands of  ', '', 'unoffending and inoffensive individuals, who,'], ['    The Rev. Nathaniel Paul commenced by  ', 'saying that he stood in the presence of that  ', '', 'large assembly of Christians, as the avowed  ', '', 'representative and advocate of the rights  ', '', 'and privileges of his brethren.  He express- ', '', 'ed himself as a decided enemy of that worst  ', 'of all systems ', ' Slavery; he cared not where,  ', 'nor under what Government it existed.  He  ', 'would not consent for one moment to make  ', '', 'a compromise with those who encouraged it  ', '', 'even in the mildest form.  It was its entire  ', '', 'extermination that he wished, and he was  ', '', 'happy in addressing an assembly of Britons  ', '', 'whose views were in unison with his own.   ', 'It was pleasing also to consider that the  ', 'combined energies of the people of God had  ', '', 'awoke, for the diffusion of the light of the  ', '', 'gospel over all the ends of the earth.  But  ', '', 'there was one portion of the world which  ', '', 'had shared little of christian sympathies, and  ', '', 'that portion had the highest claims on their  ', '', 'philanthropy.  Africa, though once visited  ', '', 'by the light of the Gospel, o™er her now  ', 'brooded a moral darkness, darker than the  ', 'sable tinge of her sons.  But God, who  ', '', 'could turn all things to good account, would  ', '', 'spread his love abroad upon that country.   ', '', 'But the darkness must remain till the stand- ', '', 'ard of the cross be raised on every hill.  He  ', '', 'anticipated the time, when churches and  ', '', 'chapels would be erected over the long neg- ', '', 'lected land, but as her situation did not en- ', 'ter into the object of the present meeting,'], ['  he would leave her where he found her.   ', '', 'Nor would he dwell on the horrors of slave- ', 'ry as it existed in the West Indies ', ' thanks  ', 'be to God it had there received its death  ', 'blow.  Whatever Britons had to boast of  ', 'their country, their history never saw a  ', '', 'prouder day than the first of August last.   ', '', 'He would confine his observations to the  ', '', 'condition of his countrymen in the United  ', '', 'States of America.  Mr. Paul then turned  ', '', 'to the formation of the settlement under the  ', '', 'British Government, which, he said, bore the  ', '', 'illustrious name of Wilberforce, and to the  ', 'education of its inhabitants.  He had no  ', 'pretence to eloquence; he would give them  ', '', 'a simple statement, and he requested a pa- ', '', 'tient hearing, especially as he labored under  ', '', 'a severe cold, and was not able to speak as  ', '', 'he could wish to do.  It was well known that  ', '', 'the United States had been designated the  ', '', '‚Land of Liberty and Equality;™ and, ac- ', '', 'cording to the professions of its inhabitants,  ', 'the land where the principles of national  ', 'liberty were best understood and practised.   ', '', 'They boasted of a republican government,  ', '', 'and their Declaration of Independence bore  ', '', 'that all men were equally entitled to main- ', 'tain their rights ', ' life, liberty, and the pur- ', 'suit of happiness.  Yet notwithstanding all  ', 'these professions, there were in 1830, 2,010,- ', '', '572 slaves, out of a population of 12,000,000;  ', '', 'or upwards of one-sixth of the population in'], ['  slavery.  He would not dwell on the physi- ', '', 'cal condition of this class of our fellow- ', '', 'creatures, because that subject had been al- ', '', 'ready fully treated of by that distinguished  ', '', 'friend of the negro, George Thompson.   ', '', '(Enthusiastic applause.)  Mr. Thompson both  ', '', 'in this city and in Edinburgh, had viewed  ', 'the matter in all its bearings, and he was  ', 'now gone to the United States of America,  ', '', 'where it was hoped he would reap the re- ', '', 'ward of his labors.  Slavery in the United  ', '', 'States had not differed much from the slavery  ', '', 'in the West Indies, as had been said by Mr.  ', '', 'Thompson and others.  In reference to the  ', '', 'manner slaves were wrought, fed, clothed,  ', '', 'and punished, it was the same.  But there  ', 'was one feature, in which it would be read- ', 'ily admitted the system was more atrocious;  ', '', 'he alluded to the internal traffic of slaves.   ', '', 'It perhaps was not known that in Virginia,  ', '', 'Maryland, and North Carolina, there was a  ', '', 'redundancy of slaves, for which a market  ', '', 'was had in the more Southern States; and  ', 'thus a regular traffic was carried on ', ' as  ', 'atrocious as ever was carried on between  ', 'the United States and Africa.  At the mar- ', '', 'ket the slaves were disposed of in the same  ', '', 'manner as cattle in this country.  (Cries of  ', '', 'Shame.)  It was not uncommon to see a  ', '', 'whole family of slaves brought into the mar- ', '', 'ket, the husband, the wife, and the children ', '  all set up on a table, and their physical'], ['  powers shown off in such a manner as to  ', '', 'bring the highest price.  He (Mr. P.) knew  ', '', 'that there was a difference of opinion as to  ', '', 'whether negroes were possessed of the same  ', '', 'tender sympathies as other people.  Some  ', '', 'doubted whether among the negroes a hus- ', '', 'band could love his wife, or a mother her chil- ', 'dren, as well as among those of mankind,  ', 'who were called the white people; but were  ', '', 'they to witness a sale of slaves they would  ', '', 'be satisfied that the feelings of the one class  ', '', 'of mortals was as powerful as those of the  ', '', 'other.  The slaves must be disposed of to  ', '', 'the highest bidder, (for they are sold by pub- ', '', 'lic auction) and it were enough to convince  ', '', 'the most sceptical to witness the tears, and  ', 'the supplications, that if the family should  ', 'be sold, they might go together.  These  ', '', 'tears and lamentations were no more heeded  ', '', 'than the lowing of cattle or the bleeting of  ', '', 'sheep.  Mr. Paul, in support of what he sta- ', '', 'ted, read extracts from ‚Stuart™s Three years  ', '', 'in America,™ narrating more fully what he  ', '', 'alluded to, respecting a sale of slaves.  He  ', '', 'then remarked, that in the southern or slave- ', 'holding States, the slaves and even the free  ', 'people of color were subject to the most se- ', 'vere laws; for example ', ' in Alabama, for  ', 'assembling for worship, or for teaching read- ', 'ing and writing, the persons guilty were sub- ', '', 'jected to a penalty from 250 to 500 dol- ', 'lars; and in some cases they were lashed.'], ['  The question was, why should such laws be  ', '', 'enacted? what objections should there be  ', '', 'to learning to read and write, or to meeting  ', '', 'in public for worship.  It was the opinion in  ', '', 'this country, that education and religion made  ', '', 'men better; but such was the nature of the  ', '', 'system, that it could not stand by the test of  ', 'truth.  The slaves would learn from reading  ', 'the Scriptures, that they were the same  ', '', 'creatures, and as accountable to God as oth- ', '', 'ers, and as much entitled to their liberty.   ', '', 'With reference to their not assembling for  ', '', 'worship, it did not form an objection to their  ', '', 'character as slaves; at the sales, it rather  ', '', 'formed a recommendation, and a testimony  ', '', 'of their worth.  It was there held forth, that  ', 'they possessed excellent characters, and as- ', 'surance were given, that they were consis- ', '', 'tent christians.  Their masters were not  ', '', 'afraid because of their religion, but they  ', '', 'were afraid, that while they met for religious  ', '', 'purposes, they would devise schemes and  ', '', 'plans by which they might effect their liber- ', '', 'ty, even to the destruction of their masters.   ', '', 'In further alluding to the condition of the  ', 'United States, Mr. Paul remarked that there  ', 'were 24 States all under one government,  ', '', 'but each capable of managing its own af- ', '', 'fairs.  In 12 of those States, he said, slave- ', '', 'ry did not prevail, but there existed a preju- ', '', 'dice against the colored people, so that even  ', '', 'in the House of God they were not permit-'], [' ted to sit in the same part as others, not were  ', 'they allowed to sit down at the table of the  ', '', 'Lord, till the others were served.  In 1829, a  ', '', 'law was passed in Ohio, compelling the free  ', '', 'people of color to leave the State in 30 days, ', '', ' under a penalty of 500 dollars, or to give  ', '', 'security that they would never become a  ', '', 'burden on the public, or consent to be sold  ', 'as slaves.  The colored people, after delib- ', 'erating, petitioned the authorities for 30 days  ', '', 'longer, and sent a petition to Sir James Cole- ', '', 'brooke, lieutenant governor of Upper Can- ', '', 'ada, inquiring what privileges would be  ', '', 'granted them in his colony.  An answer was  ', '', 'returned, breathing the spirit of a noble  ', '', 'minded Briton.  ‚Tell your Republicans,™  ', '', 'said the governor, ‚on your side of the line,  ', 'that we royalists on this side do not know  ', 'men by their color.  Should you come to us,  ', '', 'you will be entitled to all the privileges and  ', '', 'immunities of the rest of his Majesty™s sub- ', '', 'jects.™  Having received this favorable in- ', '', 'telligence form his Excellency the Governor,  ', '', 'they emigrated to that Province, and there  ', '', 'established that settlement which bears the  ', '', 'name of him, who although dead, lives in  ', 'the memories of all Christians, Wilberforce.

There was no settlement had made'], ['    The Rev. N. Paul came forward to move  ', 'the next resolution.  It was scarcely neces- ', '', 'sary, he said, to detain the meeting by any  ', '', 'remarks of his, after the able report which  ', '', 'they had heard, but nevertheless as a native  ', 'of the United States, and intimately con- ', 'nected with the slave population of that  ', '', 'country as a man of color, he would take the  ', '', 'liberty of addressing a few words to them.   ', '', 'Having read the resolution, Mr. Paul pro- ', '', 'ceeded to say, in regard to the first proposi- ', '', 'tion contained in it, that it was self-evident  ', '', 'that in order to put an end to the traffic in  ', '', 'slaves, slavery itself must be abolished.   ', 'The husbandman who was engaged in cul- ', 'tivating his fields would cease his employ- ', '', 'ment were there no market for its produce;  ', '', 'the manufacturer would at once stop his  ', '', 'machinery and dismiss his workmen were  ', '', 'the market for his manufactures to be block- ', '', 'ed up; and in like manner, were slavery  ', '', 'completely abolished, the trade in slaves  ', '', 'would fall with it.  He would not dwell on  ', 'the horrors of slavery as it existed in Ameri- ', 'ca, although he had witnessed its effects,  ', '', 'and to a certain extent felt them.  He had  ', '', 'never been a slave himself, but his father  ', '', 'had, and as a man of color he had suffered  ', '', 'under slavery™s baneful influence.  But he  ', '', 'would not touch on this part of the subject;  ', '', 'he would confine himself to the obstacles  ', '', 'which presented themselves in the way of'], ['  abolition.  Mr. Paul then proceeded to  ', '', 'speak of a communication which had been  ', '', 'made by a Board of Baptists Missions in  ', '', 'America, in reply to a remonstrance on the  ', 'part of a body of Baptists, in London, against  ', 'the perpetuation of slavery.  This reply,  ', '', 'Mr. P. said, was truly astounding to all who  ', '', 'read it.  Had he not known from whom it  ', '', 'emanated he would have supposed it the  ', '', 'production of some slaveholding planters,  ', '', 'and would have thought it a disgrace even  ', '', 'to them.  Or had Borthwick  not been chosen  ', '', 'a member of the British Parliament, he  ', 'would almost have imagined that the advo- ', 'cate of slavery had been sent for to concoct  ', '', 'this infamous document.  The reply com- ', '', 'menced, Mr. P. said, by an attempt at excus- ', '', 'ing the [s]ystem of slavery as it existed  ', '', 'in America.  It endeavored to throw the  ', '', 'blame on Britain, by saying, that while  ', '', 'America was yet a colony of England, slaves  ', '', 'were imported into that country, and im- ', 'posed upon the colonists.  This he denied.   ', 'Britain had not imposed slaves on the col- ', '', 'onists; she had only permitted the sale of  ', '', 'them; but even though the fact had been  ', '', 'as the reply stated it to be, why had the  ', '', 'Americans not abolished it when they threw  ', '', 'from themselves what they were pleased to  ', '', 'call the British yoke?  But it was not only  ', '', 'thus attempted to sanction the perpetuation of'], [' slavery; it was asserted that Congress had  ', 'no right to abolish it.  Now this was to a  ', '', 'certain extent true.  Congress had not the  ', '', 'power of interfering in the internal arrange- ', '', 'ments of particular states; but it had full  ', 'power in the District of Columbia, Arkan- ', 'sas and in Florida, and yet in all these,  ', '', 'slavery was carried on with as much as atroci- ', '', 'ty as that by which it was characterized on  ', '', 'the coast of Africa; and he would say, that  ', '', 'till it was abolished where Congress had  ', '', 'thus the power to do so, the whole nation  ', '', 'would be involved in the guilt attending it.   ', '', 'But in his reply it was also said that the  ', 'negros were not fit for liberty; and the  ', 'same cry which had been raised by the  ', '', 'West India planters about blood and car- ', '', 'nage being likely to be the result of imme- ', '', 'diate emancipation, was repeated by this  ', '', 'Board of Christian missions.  Could it be  ', '', 'believed that such sentiments were expres- ', '', 'sed by men united together for the purpose ', '', 'of spreading the knowledge of the gospel of  ', 'Christ!  He (Mr. P.) had sometimes been  ', 'asked how he could reconcile the statements  ', '', 'sometimes put forth of the strength of reli- ', '', 'gious principle in America, with the exist- ', '', 'ence of slavery, and that inquiry he had  ', '', 'never been able to solve; but if the inquirer  ', '', 'thought little of the American religion be- ', '', 'fore reading this document, what must he  ', '', 'think of it now?  Mr. P. here read an ex- ', 'tract from the Reply, in which much was'], ['   said of the existence of a general harmony  ', '', 'among all classes of Christians in forward- ', '', 'ing the cause of missions, and in energetic  ', '', 'efforts to propagate the gospel; and the ag- ', 'itation of the slave question was deprecated,  ', 'as having a tendency to break up that union,  ', '', 'many of [t]heir southern brethren, both minis- ', '', 'ters and people, being slaveholders.  Mr.  ', '', 'P. denounced this passage in indignant  ', '', 'terms.  He said there were among the Bap- ', '', 'tists many sects already; there were Cal- ', '', 'vinistic Baptists and Armenian Baptists,  ', '', 'Sixth Day Baptists and Seventh Day Bap- ', 'tists, and he (Mr. P.) considered that the  ', 'sooner another sect, a sect of Anti-Slavery  ', '', 'Baptists, were added to the number, the bet- ', '', 'ter.  Mr. P. then took a view of the num- ', '', 'bers of the different religious denominations  ', '', 'in America, and remarked, that of them all,  ', '', 'only two denominations had set themselves  ', '', 'in opposition of slavery.  The Society of  ', '', 'Friends had long since washed their hands  ', 'clean of it, and more recently the Scottish  ', 'Secession Church had resolved to hold no  ', '', 'communion with proprietors of slaves.  Could  ', '', 'the other denominations of Christians be  ', '', 'brought to act on the same principles, sla- ', '', 'very would soon be destroyed.  In order to  ', '', 'effect this, it was necessary that the enor- ', '', 'mous guilt incurred by upholding slavery,  ', '', 'should be brought home to the minds and  ', 'consciences of American christians, and he'], [' knew none so will qualified for doing this,  ', 'as Mr. George Thompson.  Had he been  ', '', 'addressing an audience who were strangers  ', '', 'to Mr. Thompson, he might have dwelt on  ', '', 'that gentleman™s talents and his zeal in the  ', 'cause; but the citizens of Glasgow had seen  ', 'him grapple with the champion of slavery,  ', '', 'and drive him from the city.  Mr. T. had  ', '', 'torn away the mask, and disclosed the hide- ', '', 'ous features of slavery, and had been great- ', '', 'ly instrumental in bringing the question, as  ', '', 'regarded the British colonies, to a happy is- ', '', 'sue.  Mr. P. then spoke of the success  ', '', 'which had attended, and was likely to at- ', 'tend, Mr. T.™s labors in America.  All that  ', 'was wanted, he said, was that Mr. T.™s  ', '', 'hands should be upheld for a short time by  ', '', 'the people in this country, until he should  ', '', 'raise a flame in America as would sus- ', '', 'tain itself.  He had heard something of a ', '', ' falling off among the friends of the cause  ', '', 'here, on the consideration that it became the  ', '', 'Americans now to do something to forward  ', 'the cause.  He would not dispute this.  It  ', 'was no doubt the duty of the Americans  ', '', 'to exert themselves for the abolition of sla- ', '', 'very; it was the duty of every slave- ', '', 'holder to emancipate his slaves; but it  ', '', 'was one thing to know what our neighbors  ', '', 'should do, and another to get them to do it.      ', '', 'The abolitionists in America were fast in- ', '', 'creasing, but they were still weak as regard- ', 'ed the ability to contribute money for the'], [' advancement of the cause.  There were  ', 'few wealthy among them, and on those few  ', '', 'there were other claims of a pressing and  ', '', 'equally benevolent nature.  Mr. P. here  ', '', 'mentioned the names of several individuals  ', 'whose every effort was directed towards the  ', 'liberation of the slaves, Arthur Tappan,  ', '', 'Wm. Lloyd Garrison, and Benj. Lundy, but  ', '', 'who were not of themselves competent for  ', '', 'the task that was before them.  The aid of  ', '', 'such a champion as Mr. T. was therefore ', '', 'invaluable, and he (Mr. P.) could not see a ', '', 'cause in which the energies of British chris- ', '', 'tians could be better employed, than in as- ', 'sisting to sustain Mr. T. in his labors.  Mr.  ', 'P. then said he would conclude by narrating  ', '', 'a simple anecodote.  A short time since as a  ', '', 'man was digging a well, some loose earth  ', '', 'and stones fell in upon him, but while he  ', '', 'was effectually prevented from getting out,  ', '', 'it providentially happened that he was not  ', '', 'struck by the falling rubbish.  His neigh- ', '', 'bor set about getting him out, and in the  ', 'intervals of their work they heard his groans.   ', 'Owing to circumstances, only two could  ', '', 'work at a time, and when their strength was  ', '', 'exhausted they were relieved by others; but  ', '', 'during the time when the change of hands  ', '', 'was effected, the poor prisoner below was  ', '', 'led from cessation of working to imagine  ', '', 'that his neighbors had given him up to his  ', '', 'fate, and he was heard to cry in agony,  ', '‚don™t leave me, don™t leave me!™  So, in like'], ['    Rev. Nathaniel Paul, of Albany. ', ' This is an im- ', 'portant resolution, in whatever light it is viewed.  No  ', 'obstacle in the way of abolition is more powerful than  ', '', 'prejudice against color.  Were I a slaveholder, and you  ', '', 'should come to me and ask for the abolition of slavery,  ', 'I would say to you, go home and do away your wicked  ', 'prejudice, which prevents colored students from enter- ', '', 'ing your colleges and seminaries, colored children from  ', '', 'enjoying the instructions of your infant schools, and  ', '', 'pious colored people from sitting at your communion  ', '', 'tables, before you preach to me.  After you have done  ', '', 'that, I will listen; until you do it, I can not hear you.   ', '', '   I went to England, and there saw a man who had  ', '', 'been in America.  He came here because he heard it  ', 'was a land of liberty.  He arrived in New York on the  ', 'Sabbath, early in the morning.  He dressed himself,  ', '', 'and went to the house of worship; went into the  ', '', 'church, walked about half way up the aisle, and was  ', '', 'there seized by the collar by a man, and hurried out  ', 'of the house ', ' the man saying, in the mean time, ﬁWhat  ', 'are you doing here, you black rascal?ﬂ  The colored  ', 'man was a Christian!  He exclaimed, as he arrived at  ', '', 'the door, Is this America? and is this American free- ', '', 'dom?  Mr. President, this is not as I was treated when  ', '', 'I went to England.  I found, at the boarding house  ', '', 'where I put up, a gentlemen of respectability, who  ', '', 'asked me if I wished to go to meeting on the Sabbath,  ', '', 'saying, if you do I will accompany you to hear Dr.  ', '', 'Raffles.  I thanked him, although I confess I stood a  ', 'little back, not being accustomed to such treatment,  ', 'such kindness, in America.  We went to meeting. ', '  The house was full, containing about 2000 people.

She did not  ', '', 'turn up her lip with scorn, nor start back as from the  ', 'approach of a viper.  When the hymn was read, she  ', 'kindly opened her hymn book and presented it to me.   ', '', 'What a striking contrast between my friend™s recep- ', '', 'tion and my own.  So much for prejudice.  No one  ', '', 'who does not wear the garment, can tell where it  ', '', 'pinches and distresses us.

There are, I am sorry  ', 'to say, two kinds of abolitionists ', ' whether in Albany  ', 'or not, I can not say.  1. That kind who hate slavery,  ', 'especially that which is 1000 or 1500 miles off.  But,  ', '', 'as bad as they hate slavery, they hate a man who  ', '', 'wears a colored skin, worse.  I only carry out the Sa- ', '', 'vior™s rule of ', 'judging trees by their fruits', '.  I do not  ', 'like wolves in sheep™s clothing.  Another kind is that  ', 'to which it is a great honor for a man to be allied ', '  those whose principles are based on the word of God  ', 'and the Declaration of Independence.  It is self-evi- ', '', 'dent that God has created all men equal.

I can not help loving them.  They  ', 'carry out the principles which the Lord Jesus Christ  ', '', 'possessed.  They carry out the spirit of the Savior™s  ', '', 'golden rule.  Though many of them are rich and hon- ', '', 'ored, yet they are not above pleading the cause of the  ', '', 'poor and dumb.   ', '   [Here Mr. P. stopped, having consumed the time al- ', 'lotted to each speaker; but cries of Go on, go on,  ', '', 'were heard.] ', '', '   I know, said he, the objection brought against us,  ', 'where we attempt to speak in our own behalf ', ' ﬁYou  want white men to make you equal with them.ﬂ  But  ', 'it is not so.

D. A. Payne, of Troy, next addressed the  ', 'Convention.  He said that he had lately had a conver- ', '', 'sation with three ministers of the gospel, one of whom  ', '', 'preached in Mississippi, and another was a planter,  ', '', 'within fifty miles of New Orleans.  They were speak- ', '', 'ing of a church in Charleston, S.C. which had re- ', '', 'cently given $3000 to the missionary cause, and they  ', '', 'had stated that Gen. Hamilton, ex-senator Hayne,  ', 'and Judge Colcock were leading spirits in that church,  ', 'and exerted the most powerful influence of any men in  ', '', 'it.  Now if it was a fact that northern churches had  ', '', 'received the large contributions of such men, knowing  ', '', 'them to be slaveholders, and justifiers of slaveholding,  ', '', 'that fact ought to be exposed.  Let the light shine:  ', '', 'and let all information which had a bearing on the  ', '', 'subject be freely given.  It was well known that the  ', '', 'large contributions of slaveholding churches to pur- ', 'poses of christian benevolence were urged by many as  ', 'proofs of their piety.  When Mr. P. had first entered  ', '', 'the ministry, he had inquired whether the churches in  ', '', 'Charleston were esteemed very pious? his informant  ', '', 'could not tell, but observed that they gave more to the  ', '', 'mission fund than almost any others.  He insisted  ', '', 'that it was the duty of the churches to bear an open  ', '', 'and explicit testimony against slavery and all who  ', '', 'uphold it.  Let their voice be heard loud as the thun- ', 'ders of heaven in denunciation of so foul an iniquity.   ', 'So long as they keep silence, the infidel understood it  ', '', 'a virtual declaration that christianity approved of  ', '', 'slavery, or at least treated it with toleration.  Mr. P.  ', '', 'related a dispute which he had with certain southern  ', '', 'ministers who urged many arguments against aboli- ', '', 'tion, and supported their objections by quotations from'], [' the bible: an infidel who was present and had attentive- ', 'ly listened to the discussion, made, at its close, this  ', 'remark ', ' ‚There is more [in the] bible to sanction slave- ', 'ry than in the heart of any honest man.™  Their apol- ', 'ogies for slavery went like a dagger into the very  ', 'heart of bible religion.  Shame for the churches, and  ', 'for the professed ambassadors of Christ, when an in- ', '', 'fidel could find in the heart of every honest man more  ', '', 'to condemn the evils of slavery than they would find  ', '', 'in the Bible.  In a conversation with an abolitionist  ', '', 'residing in Pittsburgh, who was an unbeliever in  ', '', 'Christ, that gentleman had freely admitted that the  ', '', 'bible contained a purer and more sublime system of  ', '', 'morals than the world had ever seen, but said that  ', 'professed christians had corrupted the simplicity of its  ', 'precepts ', ' and in proof quoted a certain Rev. D. D. in  ', 'Pittsburgh, whose ruling elder, a man of overwhelm- ', 'ing influence in the church, owned numbers of slaves  ', '', 'at the south, and yet his pastor dared not rebuke him  ', '', 'for his sin.  He dared not open his lips for the slave,  ', 'lest he should give offence to this rich slaveholding  ', 'elder.  Nor did the man stop here, but charged the  ', '', 'whole church at large with holding the sentiments of  ', '', 'slavery.  He said ‚he was a Jew; and when the  ', '', 'Christians brought such a charge against Moses as  ', '', 'that he sanctioned slavery, he hurled it back with in- ', '', 'dignation.  Never could a sanction be found in any- ', '', 'thing the Jewish lawgiver had done or written, for  ', '', 'such a system of cruelty and oppression as that of  ', 'American slavery.™  Thus was the christian church  ', 'rebuked, and justly, by a Jew!  It was a libel to say  ', '', 'that christianity sanctioned slavery: it frowned upon  ', '', 'it with indignation, though professed christians could'], ['   apologize for and even defend it, and the world then  ', '', 'judged of religion by its professors.  Mr. P. had men- ', '', 'tioned to this Israelite the case of the Franckean Sy- ', '', 'nod, who had resolved not to suffer a slaveholding  ', '', 'minister within its bounds, nor one who would apolo- ', '', 'gize for slavery.  The man™s eyes glistened with joy.   ', '', 'From this case it might be seen that if the churches  ', 'would come out honestly and boldly, and not leave  ', 'slaveholding a hiding place nor rest till the monster  ', '', 'had breathed its last gasp, then would the religion of  ', '', 'the Son of God stand in the pure light of her own na- ', '', 'tive heaven, and no man would be so presumptuous  ', '', 'as to say that she sanctioned the most foul and abom- ', '', 'inable filth that the nostrils of man ever smelt.'], ['    BRETHREN', ':ŠWhile I have real and abundant reasons to  ', 'pursue the usual formality, of apologizing for inadequacy, &c.

He  ', '', 'most heartily concurred in such a vote, and had no  ', '', 'doubt but that it would pass unanimously.  The name  ', '', 'of William Lloyd Garrison sounded sweet to his ear.   ', 'It produced a vibration of feeling in his bosom, which  ', 'words could but too feebly sound forth.

', '   Mr. Ray spoke with much power, and with thrilling ef- ', 'fect.  After briefly dwelling upon the principles and  ', '', 'measures of the great moral movement, he showed their  ', '', 'benign influence on the free colored population.  Not  ', '', 'only, said Mr. R., do these great principles tend to undo  ', '', 'the heavy burdens which are now crushing millions of  ', '', 'those for whom Christ died; not only do they strike off  ', '', 'the fetters from the body and souls of the oppressed;  ', '', 'but they happily tend to clear away the mountain obsta- ', 'cles which retard the free colored man, in his efforts to  ', 'qualify himself and children for usefulness in the various  ', '', 'fields of enterprise, now exclusively occupied by others,  ', '', 'but for which he is equally capacitated.  Yes, Mr. Chair- ', '', 'man, the principles of this blessed society seek the entire  ', '', 'extermination of that cruel, unnatural and awfully wicked  ', '', 'proscription, which turns away from the useful arts,  ', '', 'and from p[l]aces of profit and responsibility; and closes  ', '', 'up from us the sources of useful knowledge.  O! this  ', 'heartless prejudice!  I stand here a victim of its power.   ', 'Yes, sir, I stand here this evening a victim of this wither- ', '', 'ing, soul-killing prejudice.  What might I not have been  ', '', 'now, if I had been permitted to follow the guidance of  ', '', 'my desires.  I was impressed with the idea, that the  ', '', 'great Author of my being, had intrusted to me a mind  ', '', 'which I felt it my duty and privilege to cultivate; I gain-'], ['  ed admission to the seminary found[e]d by the denomina- ', '', 'tion of my own choice, located at Middletown, Conn.; I  ', '', 'rejoiced in view of the prospect which spread out before  ', '', 'me, of a favorable opportunity of acquiring that moral  ', '', 'and intellectual cultivation, requisite to the responsible  ', '', 'work of the holy ministry; but alas! alas! how did my  ', '', 'heart sink within me, when I first discovered that even  ', 'in my supposed retreat from the world and its persecu- ', 'tions, the monster was exercising his murderous influ- ', '', 'ence. ', '   Mr. Chairman, I have not language justly to portray  ', '', 'the emotions that agitated my lacerated bosom, when by  ', '', 'the repelling influence of prejudice exerci[s]ed by my ', 'sup- ', 'posed ﬁChristian brethren,ﬂ', ' and fellow students, I was  ', 'compelled to abandon the University, and with it all hope  ', '', 'of acquiring a liberal education; for I then found the col- ', 'leges throughout the land closed against me.  In an in- ', 'stant all my fond hopes were blasted.  The only conso- ', '', 'lation I found in this dark hour, was in pouring my sor- ', '', 'rows into the bosom of the God of the poor and oppress- ', '', 'ed.  But a new day has dawned upon us.  Since the ef- ', '', 'forts of the American Anti-Slavery Society, new and  ', '', 'powerful motives have been hung out, as it were from  ', '', 'heaven, beckoning us onward and upward, in every thing  ', '', 'useful and ennobling.  The doors of literary institutions  ', 'have been thrown open.  Facilities are every day increas- ', 'ing, for affording our sons and daughters such physical,  ', '', 'intellectual and moral training, as shall prepare them to  ', '', 'set their part with usefulness to society. ', '', '   Mr. Chairman, the sentiment expressed in this resolu- ', '', 'tion, ﬁThat the principles and measures of the American  ', '', 'Anti-Slavery Society have a practical illustration, in the'], ['  presentation of new and powerful motives to that class of  ', '', 'our fellow citizens more particularly identified with the  ', '', 'enslaved, for efforts for their improvement,ﬂ is true to the  ', '', 'letter.'], ['    Mr. Remond, on rising to address the company,  ', 'was loudly cheered.  That he felt deeply (he said) the  ', '', 'honor they were inclined to bestow by assembling  ', '', 'on the present occasion, he needed not to express,  ', '', 'and he hoped that his appreciation of the demonstra- ', '', 'tion so far as regarded himself, might be verified in  ', '', 'another way than words.  The temperance and an- ', '', 'ti-slavery reformations were two of the most popu- ', 'lar subjects of agitation of the day, on which mere  ', 'fine speeches were little, but he hoped if his life  ', '', 'was spared to be able to show his appreciation of  ', '', 'their kindness by his conduct, not only with regard  ', '', 'to temperance and slavery, but with regard to every  ', '', 'other cause which had for its object the good of his  ', '', 'fellow-creatures.  (Cheers.)  The temperance cause  ', '', 'was not new to him, although he had never joined  ', '', 'but one temperance society in his own country, but  ', 'he believed, that conduct was of much more conse- ', 'quence than profession, in this, as well as in other  ', '', 'matters, and he could with sincerity avow, that he  ', '', 'was a warm friend of the temperance movement.   ', '', 'In the United States, the anti-slavery cause and the  ', '', 'temperance cause were almost synonymous.  It was  ', '', 'true that many supported the temperance cause who  ', '', 'were not abolitionists, but there were no abolition- ', '', 'ists who were not likewise friends of the cause of  ', 'temperance.  (Cheers.)  The abolitionists of Ameri- ', 'ca felt interested in the temperance cause for many  ', '', 'reasonsŠas friends of suffering humanity, of good  ', '', 'morals, and of the good of society in general; but  ', '', 'when they learned, likewise, that intemperance had  ', '', 'been one of the chief supports of slavery in that  ', '', 'country, then they felt doubly strong in their indig-'], [' nation at the venders of such an article.  The tem- ', 'perance cause had made rapid progress in the Unit- ', '', 'ed States, but there was much yet to be done in that  ', '', 'country, and a great deal more to be done in this.   ', '', '(Hear, hear.)  The slave trade on the coast of Afri- ', '', 'ca was sustained by ardent spirits.  Where could  ', '', 'they find a man not excited by the use of ardent  ', '', 'spirits, who could lay his hand on innocent man,  ', 'woman, or child, fasten fetters upon them, and con- ', 'sign to all the horrors of a middle passage?  Where  ', '', 'could they find a man, even for filthy lucre, who  ', '', 'would be disposed to throw into the sea an entire  ', '', 'cargo of human beings, when pursued by British  ', '', 'cruisers, if they had not indulged in the use of ar- ', '', 'dent spirits, and were thus rendered reckless in the  ', '', 'commission of the most atrocious crimes?  That  ', '', 'he had at one time disposed of ardent spirits, he  ', 'would regret till the day of his death, and he would  ', 'make any sacrifice, if he could stand there and say  ', '', 'he had never been engaged in dealing in that arti- ', '', 'cle, the cause of so much misery and war.  He felt  ', '', 'borne down with the view of the amount of intem- ', '', 'perance in his own country and in this, and he  ', '', 'hoped they had come there that night determined to  ', '', 'carry forward the great work of temperance.  (Loud  ', '', 'cheers.)  A great change was going on in America  ', 'on this question, and it would do more if it should  ', 'succeed, to benefit not only the slave, but society in  ', '', 'general, than any other question that could be agi- ', '', 'tated there at this time.  (Cheering.)  In order to  ', '', 'carry it into full effect, they must have the co-opera- ', '', 'tion of England.  The notice of such a meeting as  ', '', 'that would have a vast effect on the other side of'], [' the Atlantic.  It was known to the most of them  ', 'that when temperance commenced there, it was  ', '', 'very unpopular indeed, but what had been the result  ', '', 'of that agitation?  Hundreds of societies had been  ', '', 'formed, the decrease in the consumption of ardent  ', '', 'spirits had been immense, thousands had ceased to  ', '', 'deal in the article, many distilleries had been stop- ', '', 'ped, and the capital employed in them turned into  ', 'better, and he hoped as profitable channels of manu- ', 'facturers or commerce.  (Cheers.)  The time was  ', '', 'not distant, he hoped, when the temperance cause  ', '', 'would become the great enterprise of the day, and  ', '', 'he hoped they would make up their mind so firmly  ', '', 'and fully, that no threats or influence would be suf- ', '', 'ficient to deter them from being faithful laborers in  ', '', 'the cause of temperance, and chase from the face of  ', '', 'society in this country, as well as the United States,  ', 'the last vestige of intemperance.  After noticing  ', 'the shocking scenes which were so frequently ex- ', '', 'hibited on the streets, and which were the result of  ', '', 'the use of ardent spirits, he referred to the immense  ', '', 'number of public houses on the roads of Scotland,  ', '', 'where almost nothing could be got by the traveller  ', '', 'but whiskey; and concluded this part of his address  ', '', 'by reading ‚The Drunkard™s Will.™  Mr. R. then  ', '', 'turned the attention of the meeting to the subject of  ', 'American slavery.  He showed the unfounded na- ', 'ture of the prejudice which existed in that country  ', '', 'against the entire free colored population.  They  ', '', 'were told, he said, that the colored man was only fit  ', '', 'to be a slave and servant, and while they were con- ', '', 'tent to continue slaves, they were the finest fellows  ', '', 'in the world; but when they would be men, when'], [' they would prove themselves industrious and sober  ', 'citizens, then they were considered almost unfit to  ', '', 'breathe in the same house with those whose sole  ', '', 'right to the possession of the privileges which  ', '', 'they enjoyed was founded on the principle that all  ', '', 'men were equal.  Mr. R. read extracts from an  ', '', 'American paper to show the way in which the eman- ', '', 'cipation of the West India slaves was celebrated by  ', 'the colored population of New-York, and the grate- ', 'ful and manly sentiments which they entertained to- ', '', 'wards those who had shown themselves attached to  ', '', 'the cause of humanity and justice.  After a long ad- ', '', 'dress on the same subject, he concluded by urging  ', '', 'upon the meeting to persevere in their endeavors to  ', '', 'emancipate the American slaves, as essential to the  ', '', 'destruction of that prejudice which was so baneful  ', '', 'to the happiness and true interests of the whole com- ', 'munity of the United States.  Mr. Remond resum- ', 'ed his seat amidst the most marked demonstrations  ', '', 'of applause.   ', '', '   The chairman said, if there was a single individ- ', '', 'ual in that meeting who entertained any doubt that  ', '', 'the colored man was not a human being, he would  ', '', 'not now need to consult the American slaveholder  ', '', 'on the subject, for he must be convinced that  ', '', 'Charles Remond was a man.  (Cheers.)  After a  ', 'few further remarks, the chairman concluded by an- ', 'nouncing a supply of fruit.  The company having  ', '', 'likewise been favored with a song from Mr. Water- ', '', 'son.'], ['   Mr. M. ROPER addressed the meeting, and stated a  ', 'number of facts which had come under his own know- ', '', 'ledge, demonstrative of the horrors and cruelties of Ame- ', '', 'rican slavery.  One case which he mentioned, was that of  ', '', 'a slave who occasionally preached to his fellow-bondsmen.   ', 'His master threatened that if he ever preached on the  ', 'Sabbath again, he would give him 500 lashes on the Mon- ', '', 'day morning.  He disobeyed the order, however, and  ', '', 'preached, unknown to his master.  He became alarmed, ', '', ' and ran away from Georgia, and crossed the river into South  ', '', 'Carolina, where he took refuge in a barn belonging to a  ', '', 'Mr. Garrison.  Mrs. Garrison saw him in the barn, and  ', '', 'informed her husband of it.  Mr. Garrison got his rifle  ', '', 'and shot at him.  The law required that they should call  ', 'upon the slave to stop three times before they fired at him;  ', 'Mr. Garrison called, but he did not stop.  The ball missed  ', '', 'him, and Mr. Garrison then struck him with the gun and  ', '', 'knocked him down.  The slave wrested it from him, and  ', '', 'struck him [Mr. G.] with it.  The slave was taken up for  ', '', 'it; his master went after him; Mr. Garrison purchased  ', '', 'him for 500 dollars, and burned him alive.'], ['   [ – The CHAIRMAN expressed a wish that the interim ', 'should be filled up by Mr. M. Roper™s stating some facts ', '', 'with which he was conversant. ', '', '   Considerable opposition was made to this suggestion.

(Hear, hear, and faint applause.)] ', '', '   Mr. ROPER then stood forward, and observed with con- ', '', 'siderable warmth, that Dr. Cox did pay a portion towards  ', '', 'his education, but that should not hinder him from advo- ', '', 'cating the cause of his mother, brethren, and sisters, now  ', 'in bondage.  (Loud cheers.)  He was grateful to Dr. Cox  ', 'for that which he was doing for him; but at the same time  ', '', 'his principles were not to be bought.  (Cheers.)  There was  ', '', 'not a Christian Society in America, which did not hold  ', '', 'slaves, except the Society of Friends.  (Cheers.)  In Salem,  ', '', 'a town in South Carolina, containing perhaps 20,000  ', '', 'Quakers, there was not a single slave, though they were  ', '', 'surrounded by a slave-holding population.  (Cheers.)  He  ', '', 'had run away from his master, and was going to see his  ', 'mother in North Carolina.  He had to pass through the  ', 'town of Salisbury, where there was a Quaker in gaol who'], ['was to be executed on the following Friday, for having  ', 'given a slave a free pass.  (Shame, shame.)  Mr. Thompson  ', '', 'had given them an account of some bad slaveholders; he  ', '', '(Mr. R.) would tell them of some good ones.  A master  ', '', 'with whom he once lived, Mr. Beveridge, in travelling  ', 'from Apalache to Columbia, having to pass through the  ', 'Indian nations, it was necessary for him to take arms.  He  ', '', 'was taken exceedingly ill, and could neither stand up nor  ', '', 'sit down.  He had a truck with him containing 20,000 dol- ', '', 'lars, and he (Mr. R.) took the pistols and protected his  ', '', 'master and his master™s property.  When he arrived at  ', '', 'Columbia, his master becoming embarrassed in circum- ', '', 'stances, sold him on a block; that was his kindness to him  ', '', '(Mr. R.) for saving his master™s life and protecting his  ', 'property.  Another good master was Colonel M™Gillion, a  ', 'Scotchman, who held about 300 slaves, and who used to  ', '', 'boast that he never flogged them.  His mode of punishing  ', '', 'them was to get a rice hogshead, into which several nails  ', '', 'were driven about a quarter of an inch through, and the  ', '', 'slaves then being fasten in, he used to roll them down a  ', '', 'very steep hill.

', '', '   Therefore, in calling your attention to a subject which has for months ', 'agitated and pained your mind, in relation to myself and others, I shall endeavor ', 'to confine myself to a plain and unsophisticated statement of facts in the ', '', 'matter, and leave you to judge who is ﬁ', 'reckless of principle', 'ﬂ in the affairŠ ', 'David Ruggles, the Committee of Vigilance, or the very Rev. Samuel E. Cornish. ', 'In the outset permit me to express the conviction of my mind as to whom in this ', '', 'affair the blame should be attached.  I hesitate not to say that all parties are more ', 'or less to blame, as must ever be the case when friend rises against friend, and brother ', 'against brother, in violent hostility against each other.  Therefore, you will ', 'understand, that I profess not t be entirely blameless in every respect.  I am ', 'ready on some points, to enter the plea guilty; but to the chargeŠ ', '', 'ﬁreckless of principle,', 'ﬂ or crime, I plead NOT GUILTY. ', '   The matter to which I shall first call your attention is my connection and ', 'ﬁtrouble with the Vigilance Committee.ﬂ ', '', '   II.ŠThe late ﬁ', 'Libel Suit', 'ﬂ in which we were involved, and the ﬁColored ', 'American.ﬂ ', '   First, The place which I have occupied as a member, as Secretary and ', 'Agent of ﬁThe New-York Committee of Vigilance,ﬂ having rendered me ', 'somewhat notorious on some occasions of interest to the cause of human ', 'freedom, I am satisfied that a large majority of this respectable audience are ', 'acquainted with the speaker, and the fact of his being thus employed to promote ', 'the objects of that institution.  Therefore, I have only to remark under this head, ', '', 'that as two-thirds of my time, during the first six months of my agency was ', 'employed in my book store, two hundred dollars was considered to be adequate ', 'compensation for the time I devoted to our great and good cause.  But so ', '*   The speaker was interrupted in his remarks by Phillip A. Bell, and W. ', 'P. Johnson, who were anxious to obtain the floor.  Their speeches are [informed,] ', '', 'and extracts appear in the following pages. ', '     [The Rev. Samuel E. Cornish, Theodore S. Wright, and Mr. William Johnp', ' ston, Treasurer of the New York Committee of Vigilance, were particularly ', 'invited to attend, but did not appear.]'], ['   pressing were the claims and demands of the poor and needy upon the Society ', 'for relief, that the Committee decided that from the 20', 'th May, 1836, that the  ', 'whole of my time should be employed in protecting and relieving such of our ', 'endangered countrymen and women as might be found here, illegally aggrieved, ', 'or liable to be kidnapped and reduced to slavery. ', '   As my circumstances would not admit of my devoting my whole time ', '', 'to the cause without remuneration, the Committee promised to pay their ', 'Secretary adequate compensation for services and labor. ', '   Feeling a deep interest for our shorn race, and confiding in the promises ', '', 'of those with whom he had been so long, and so firmly united by the strong, ', 'though tender cords of sympathy and friendship for each other and outraged human ', 'nature,Šthat the claims of humanity were so deeply interesting, that the idea of ', '', 'personal interest was never sufficiently regarded on the part of their Secretary ', 'to effect a positive understanding, as to what the Society would consider ', 'a just remuneration as salary for time and labor which he was called to bestow, ', 'until the 27', 'th of November, 1838, when the opacity which effects his vision ', 'compelled the Secretary earnestly to press upon the notice of the Society the ', '', 'importance of their naming a definite sum, and effecting an early settlement, that ', 'he might possess adequate means to settle his business, and retire for a season ', 'from the exciting field of labor, to a state of quiet in Paris, where he was ', '', 'persuaded by his physician and friends that he could find permanent relief from ', 'the threatening malady.  At the meeting referred to, the subject of a settlement ', 'with the Secretary was taken up and discussed by eight of the members of the ', '', 'Executive Committee.  But they decided to remunerate their Secretary with a  ', 'salary at the rate of $400 per annum, for two and a half years labor.  Though ', 'I felt disappointed and dissatisfied at the manner in which the subject was ', 'treated, knowing that the Committee had employed Rev. C. Turner on a salary ', 'at the rate of $600 per annum, exclusive of his travelling expenses, and a  ', '', 'commission of 20 per cent on all moneys by him collected over a certain sum, for ', 'performing the duties of financial agent only. ', '   The dissatisfaction was not entertained in my mind, from the fact, that the ', '', 'Society awarded the Financial Agent compensation equal at least to $1,000 per ', 'annum for his services, but from a sense of manifest injustice towards their ', 'Secretary, who had the honor of performing the labor of General Agent, Financial ', 'Agent, and Secretary, until he was compelled to yield to the infirmity which has ', 'been produced and encouraged in his eyes by the mental and physical excitement ', '', 'to which he has been subjected by the performance of his arduous duties. ', '  The Treasurer of the Committee was requested to settle with the Secretary, ', 'on their own terms.  After Mr. Johnston, the Treasurer, examined his ', 'accounts, he ', 'reported on paper so J. W. Higgins, Esq., the amount which he believed to be'], ['  due, exclusive of the sums which the Secretary had received as salary. ', '   As a difference of opinion existed between the Treasurer and myself as to the ', 'correctness of his report, a part only of the amount reported to be due was paid ', '', 'by a promissory note, from J. W. Higgins, dated December 4', 'th, 1838.  The ', 'Secretary feeling deeply interested at the Treasurer™s manifest inability to render ', 'a correct account, offered to render him every assistance in his power. ', '', '   The misunderstanding was in relation to the amount which the Treasurer had ', 'paid to the Secretary as salary, to January 1838.  In December, my friend, Mr. ', 'Williams, who had kindly tendered me a free passage to Europe, departed, leaving ', 'me behind.  The matter to which I shall call your attention in connection with the ', 'expence of the libel suit, became more and more interesting.  A part of my salary ', '', 'was to be appropriated to defray the expenses of the suit in which we were ', 'involved.  Finally, the Treasurer rashly ventured to assume, that he had even paid ', 'the Secretary the amount which he acknowledged to be due.  Of course the ', '', 'terms of a settlement became ', 'exceedingly', ' interesting. ', '   Secondly', 'ŠThe ﬁLIBEL SUIT,ﬂ and the ﬁCOLORED AMERICAN.ﬂ ', '   The course pursued by some of the members of the Committee, with the  ', '', 'editor of the ﬁColored American,ﬂ was mean, puerile and contemptible.  The ', 'matter was made a pretext to affect the Secretary, in relation to an affair with the ', 'Rev. T. S. Wright, which did not concern the ﬁColored American,ﬂ nor the ', 'Society.  The facts in relation to the suit are as follows:ŠThe ﬁLibel Suitﬂ ', 'grew out of the publication of Mr. Gavino™s letter, which appeared in the ', '', 'ﬁColored American,ﬂ in October, 1837; in which Mr. Gavino communicated ', 'certain facts in relation to the fate of three native Africans, who were enticed ', 'from on board the brig Governor Temple, of Gambier, in the fall of 1836, and ', '', 'sent to the south on board the vessel Robert Center, where Mr. Gavino states that ', 'they were cruelly treated, and that efforts were made to reduce them to slavery. ', 'Mr. Gavino having interfered in their behalf, was compelled to leave the vessel at ', '', 'New Orleans, with the Africans, where they were exposed to the mercy of their ', 'avaricious inveiglers.  Mr. Gavino™s letter was dated New Orleans, January, ', '1837, and directed to ﬁDavid Ruggles, Secretary of the New-York Committee of ', 'Vigilance.ﬂ  The facts were so roughly stated, that the Committee declined ', 'publishing the letter in their Annual Report, published in January, 1837, but  ', '', 'referred to the facts, which may be read on page 33 of the Report.  After Mr. G. ', 'returned to this city in August, 1837, he was called upon by a member of the ', 'Committee at 22 Rosevelt-street, where his letter was revised, and sent to the ', '', 'editor of the ﬁColored American,ﬂ by the Secretary of the Committee of Vigilance, ', 'and was published at the time referred to.  The person implicated in having ', 'shipped the Africans by stratagem, and forced them on board the vessel, sued the ', '', 'Secretary of the Committee of Vigilance, the editor, publisher and printer of the'], ['  Colored American, for publishing against him a libel.  A meeting of the members ', 'of the Committee of Vigilance was invited at the corner of Hudson and Broome ', 'streets, for the purpose of taking measures to defend the suit; three members ', '', 'only, (who formed a quorum, however,) attended the meeting, viz.ŠT. S. Wright, ', 'William Johnston, and David Ruggles.  They decided, after examining the case, ', 'that it was the duty of the Committee to defend the persons who were involved, ', '', 'by sustaining the expense of the suit, and authorized the Secretary of the Com- ', 'mittee to engage R. & T. Sedgwick, Esqrs., as counsel in the case, in behalf of ', 'the New-York Committee of Vigilance.  A note was accordingly addressed to ', 'them, soliciting their professional services in the suit.  In the Report of the ', 'Committee, published in January, 1838, the libel suit is particularly referred to.Š ', '', 'From that period to the 15', 'th October, 1838, the libel suit was defended and ', 'sustained by authority, and at the expense of the NEW-YORK COMMITTEE OF ', 'VIGILANCE.  The expense of the suit in July was $45.00, and was paid on the  ', '', '11th by the Committee.  The cost of the suit in October, was $65.25, which was ', 'paid by the ', 'New-York Committee of Vigilance', ', independent of the expense of ', 'subpening witnesses from time to time in behalf of the defendants.  The case ', '', 'was tried on the 15', 'th of October, and the verdict was against the defendants, ', 'owing, as was generally believed, and as the Colored American informed its ', 'readers, to ', 'prejudice', ' in the ', 'jury-box', '.  I have not the least doubt that the name ', 'ﬁDavid Ruggles,ﬂ being so odious at that time to the minds of the jury, from the ', 'false statements by the commercial press in relation to the ﬁ', 'Darg case', ',ﬂ was the ', 'main ground upon which the verdict was rendered against us.  Subsequent to the  ', '15th of October, a meeting of the Committee was held at 18 Liberty-street, for ', 'the purpose of adopting measures to defray the expense of the ', 'Libel Suit', 'Š present, George M. Tracy, William P. Johnson, J. W. Higgins, T. S. Wright, ', 'S. E. Cornish, and the Secretary.  G. M. Tracy in the chair.  It was voted that ', 'the committee should ', 'raise the necessary means to pay the expense of the Libel', ' Suit.  ', 'S. E. Cornish, George M. Tracy, W. Johnston, T. S. Wright, and J. W. ', 'Higgins, were appointed a committee to collect the sum required. For this ', 'purpose, appeals were made to the public through the columns of the Colored ', 'American, which were responded to by our friends in this city, in Rochester, in ', 'Pittsburg, in Ohio, and in other parts of the country, who sent their donations to ', '', 'extricate the Committee of Vigilance, and the Colored American from the un- ', 'righteous responsibility in which we were involved.  Meeting after meeting was ', 'held in this city, by the Committee, and attended by their friends, many of whom ', '', 'are present.  The last public meeting upon the subject was held on the 20', 'th of ', 'November, and addressed by James G. Birney, S. E. Cornish, Wm. Johnston, ', 'T. S. Wright, and J. W. Higgins, in behalf of the Committee of Vigilance, and ', '', 'a collection taken up and pledges received, to aid the Society in defraying the'], ['  expenses of ', 'their', ' LIBEL SUIT. ', '   About this time, or soon after, T. S. Wright and myself had trouble, about ', 'which you have already heard too muchŠwhere all the humbugs and crickets, and ', '', 'other ﬁ', 'blundering', 'ﬂ things were hatched from five to seven years of age, which ', 'has enabled the editor of the Colored American to furnish his readers with so ', 'much interesting matter n connection with my name.  The clouds collected thick ', '', 'and blackŠthe lightning flashedŠthe thunders rolledŠthe storm threatened instant ', 'annihilation.  So a caucus meeting of the Committee of Vigilance, was gotten ', 'up on the 11', 'th January last, in the absence, and without the knowledge of the ', 'Secretary, who was ', 'then', ' and ', 'there', ' accused, arraigned, denounced, ', 'calumniated', ', and ', 'condemned, as he has been informed, in a manner too shocking to relate.Š ', '', 'Mr. Cornish expressed his suspicions, Mr. Johnston expressed his convictionsŠ ', 'Mr. Wright confirmed their opinions, and laughed in his sleeveŠhe could not ', 'now remember that the Secretary was authorized at the meeting referred to in ', '', 'October 1837, to employ counsel to defend the Libel suit.  Mr. Johnston ventured ', 'to assume that the suit did not belong to the New-York Committee of Vigilance, ', 'and it was placed upon the head of David Ruggles, where it has remained from that ', '', 'period to the present, although my letter to G. M. Tracy, Esq., President of the ', 'New-York Committee of Vigilance, resigning the office of Secretary and Agent ', 'is dated January 12', 'th, 1839.  I had no knowledge of the dark proceedings of ', 'the caucus meeting referred to, until after the 19', 'th of January, when the editor ', 'of the Colored American, assassin like, believing as he remarks in his paper, ', '', 'that his victim was ﬁ', 'on his back', ',ﬂ reached over the committee in an article ', 'under the caption ﬁ', 'The Libel Suit', ',ﬂ and stabbed me.  He informed the ', 'public that the Libel Suit neither belonged to the Committee of Vigilance nor to ', '', 'the Colored American, but to David Ruggles, or to ', 'Ruggles & Russell', '.  He ', 'then (consistent with Arnoldism,) bid for a bribe, by pledging himself to the public ', 'to ﬁhave nothing to do withﬂ his brethren, (RŠs and RŠl,) if they would ', '', 'send him a few dollars.  Although I had been informed on a particular ', 'occasion by the Rev. T. S. Wright, that the Libel suit would be made a personal ', 'matter to effect my reputation, I had no suspicion that the editor of the ', 'Colored American had taken so deep a part in the tragedy, until after he exposed ', 'my confidential letter to him, expressing grief and surprise at his course, and ', '', 'stating some facts, explaining reasons why I could not contribute more towards ', 'defraying the expense of the Libel Suit.  The letter referred to is marked No. 1,  ', 'and reads thus:Š'], ['                                                                                         Office, 36 Lispenard Street, ', '', '                                                                                         New-York, Jan. 19, 1839. ', '   REV. S. E. CORNISHŠ ', '      Dear SirŠThis comes to you from a ', 'deeply injured', ' and afflicted friend. ', '      How could you publish the innuendo against me, that appears in the ', 'ﬁColored Americanﬂ of to-day, after stating as I did my case to Mr. Bell, the ', 'other day, who doubtless informed you and Mr. S. of my embarrassment for want ', '', 'of means!  I think, sir, that you evince an ', 'anti-christian spirit', ', by reaching over ', 'the Committee to stab me.

In William Johnston I am deceived!'], ['    MR. CHAIRMAN ', ' Sir, Mr. Johnson appears here, as is evident from his speech,  ', 'as a deeply interested witness ', ' bearing testimony against me for himself, for his  ', 'pastor the Rev. T. S. Wright, for the ﬁCommittee of Vigilance,ﬂ for the ﬁland  ', 'speculators,ﬂ and for Tom, Dick and Harry, to prove me responsible in the Libel  ', '', 'Suit.  I consider Mr. Johnson™s testimony in this case, where he testifies to the  ', '', 'negative', ' testimony of T. S. Wright and William Johnston, concerning the meeting  ', 'which was held in October, 1837, at the corner of Hudson and Broome streets, of  ', 'infinite importance, because it establishes my position beyond question.  He admits  ', '', 'that Wright and Johnston attended the meeting, but that they do not now recollect  ', '', 'having authorised the Secretary to employ counsel to defend the suit.  Now I hold  ', 'that the negative testimony of twenty witnesses in a case is good for nothing, when  ', 'the positive testimony of one witness establishes the fact. ', '', '   I affirm, in the case of the Libel Suit, that the Committee authorised the Se- ', 'cretary to employ counsel to defend the suit.  Mr. Johnson denies that the meeting  ', 'which was held on the 11', 'th Jan. at 217 William-st., was a caucus meeting.  I regret  ', 'that he does not understand the character of a caucus meeting: if he does, I cannot  ', '', 'conceive how he can possess effrontery to deny, that the meeting to which I have  ', 'referred was one of the most contemptible caucus meetings that was ever held by  ', 'any Society; I was Secretary of the Society at the time, and the meeting was  ', '', 'gotten up without my knowledge by certain treacherous members, to arraign me.  I  ', 'pronounce the meeting a caucus, because they neglected ', ' intentionally too ', ' to  ', 'invite all parties concerned.  Now, sir, the ﬁ', 'family', ' affair', 'ﬂ to which Mr. Johnson  ', 'has referred, is, in my opinion too delicate a matter for the public to scan.  As Mr.  ', 'Wright has furnished the public with his version of the tale, I regret that he is not  ', 'present to help his representative out, as it appears to be interesting, and very much  ', '', 'to the point, in proving me ﬁreckless of principleﬂ in the business of the Libel suit.   ', 'Since the Rev. Theodore S. Wright and his friend have manifested so much regard  ', 'for the reputation of the defenceless party, by exposing letters and making the  ', '', 'affair a matter of public notoriety, it is proper I should state, that the ﬁfamily  ', '', 'affairﬂ grew out of an honorable correspondence between myself and the defence- ', 'less party.  As the consent of the guardian had been obtained by the parties, to  ', 'continue the correspondence, it was not supposed that the match-making step  ', '', 'father would have interfered on the ground that I am not a clergyman.  My ad- ', '', 'versary knows that this affair is the very acorn of the umbrageous tree that shades'], ['  us all ', ' under which the gallows is erected and the pit is dug! ', ' where it is de- ', 'creed that the ﬁblundering youthﬂ must be ', 'executed and ', 'buried', ', without trial or  ', 'benefit of ', 'CLERGY', ', nolens volens. ', '   The land business to which Mr. Johnson has called your attention, which  ', 'has been like most speculations, an unfortunate affair for all concerned, is another  ', '', 'matter as irrelevant to the business of this meeting as would be his own private  ', '', 'family affairs, or the business between himself and his creditors.  As Mr. Cornish  ', 'has remarked upon the ﬁland speculatorsﬂ in No. 104 of the Colored American, and  ', 'as there appears to be a disposition to drag the matter up here, permit me to state,  ', '', 'that it has no more to do with the ﬁ', 'Libel Suit', ',ﬂ the ﬁColored American,ﬂ or the  ', 'com of Vigilance, than the Revds. Samuel E. Cornish, C. B. Ray, and Theodore S.  ', 'Wright™s Newark lot speculations had to do with the speculations of the clergy in  ', 'the moon.  Mr. Wright has manifested such an indomitable penchant to obtain  ', '', 'matter from any and every quarter to effect me, that in March last, as I am in- ', '', 'formed, at the house of Henry Davis, where a meeting of the Union Land Co. was  ', 'held, he remarked in an emphatic tone, ﬁBrethren, if Mr. Ruggles ', 'swims', ' we must  ', 'sink', '!  He has sent a letter to brother Cornish, bidding us all defiance ', ' if there is  ', 'anything against him here, we must have it!ﬂ  The simple facts in relation to the  ', 'Land Company are as follows.  The Rev. Mr. Ray and myself, in 1836, agreed to  ', '', 'participate in land speculation; accordingly sixty lots were purchased in my name  ', 'in New Haven.  He got up the company, who ', 'refused', ' $6000 for their lots. ', '  Before the first installment was paid, Mr. Ray ', 'backed out, and some others with  ', 'him.  The pressure of ™37 came ', ' and confidence left the company.  In 1838  ', 'the mortgage threatened to foreclose upon us, and those who should have been  ', 'peace-makers have stirred up and encouraged strife.  Mr. Edward V. Clark can  ', '', 'testify to Mr. Ray™s course in that business.   ', '', '   Mr. J. inquires why I did not add the names F. Chatfield and M. Strong.  I  ', 'can add them, with those of Messrs. Johnson and Landryne, who are mem- ', 'bers of Mr. Wright™s congregation, and are subject to his clerical dictation. ', '  Since I have detected the treachery of Revds. Samuel E. Cornish, T. S. Wright,  ', 'and C. B. Ray, in relation to the ﬁLand Speculators,ﬂ I consider them three of  ', '', 'the most dangerous clerical ', 'wolves', ' that ever appeared in sheep™s clothing.   ', '   My difficulty with Mr. Van Rensalaer commenced with his course towards my  ', 'friend J. W. Higgins, or the firm J. W. & D. Higgins, who were also ﬁsatisfied with'], ['  me.ﬂ  I became bail for Mr. V., who was accused with assaulting his neighbor.  On  ', '', 'the day of the trial he left this city for New Jersey, and on his return was arrested and  ', 'committed, until his pastor, the Rev. Mr. Wright, succeeded in obtaining his libera- ', 'tion.  His excuse for deserting his bail was, that I was a minor, and could not be  ', '', 'injured.  The attempt which Weaver made upon Messrs. Patterson, Gustin and  ', '', 'myself, before he decamped from the city, entitles him to the character of a fugi- ', 'tive from justice.    ', '   Sir, this representative of the Committee of Vigilance, Mr. Johnson, admits  ', 'the whole matter at issue ', ' that the ﬁLibel Suitﬂ belongs to the Society; that  ', 'they paid the money, and that $400 per annum was not just compensation.  Hear  ', 'him ', ' ﬁI know that his', ' services were worth', ' MORE', ', and ', 'SO DID THE COMMITTEE', ' (!)  ', 'We all knew that his services were ', 'invaluable', '!ﬂ  Precious confession!  Why  ', 'did not the Committee confess ', 'judgment', ' and plead ', 'poverty', ' before! ', '   The apology of my adversary for Mr. Cornish™s ignorance of me, as well as  ', '', 'for his remarks in the paper, has come too late.  His prime witness and swearing  ', '', 'representative, Mr. Bell, testifies that he was ﬁgoaded onﬂ to the ﬁ', 'attack', 'ﬂ proving  ', 'malice in his heart.  How can the double-dealing, priest-ridden goat stand mum  ', 'and see me exterminated on account of $17 50, when he heard the Treasurer  ', '', 'admit before J. W. Higgins, that it was justly applied, and other sums, to the relief  ', '', 'of refugees.

Anti- ', '', 'Slavery Society, which he has not paid, and $35 to Mr. Trow, which he has not paid?  ', 'Why has he not stated that the mutual arbitration of friends detected a blunder  ', 'where he had charged to me in his account $100 which had been paid, according  ', '', 'to his book, to Piercy & Reed, and that Mr. Piercy testified to the receipt of the  ', '', 'same before the arbitration?

RAY, ', '   Resolved, That the tendency of the principles and  ', '', 'measures of the American A. S. Society, are practically  ', '', 'illustrated, by their happy influence upon that class of our  ', '', 'fellow citizens, more immediately identified with the en- ', '', 'slaved millions of our land; by presenting new and pow- ', '', 'erful motives for efforts for their moral and intellectual  ', '', 'improvement. ', '   Mr. Ray spoke with much power, and with thrilling ef- ', 'fect.  After briefly dwelling upon the principles and  ', '', 'measures of the great moral movement, he showed their  ', '', 'benign influence on the free colored population.  Not  ', '', 'only, said Mr. R., do these great principles tend to undo  ', '', 'the heavy burdens which are now crushing millions of  ', '', 'those for whom Christ died; not only do they strike off  ', '', 'the fetters from the body and souls of the oppressed;  ', '', 'but they happily tend to clear away the mountain obsta- ', 'cles which retard the free colored man, in his efforts to  ', 'qualify himself and children for usefulness in the various  ', '', 'fields of enterprise, now exclusively occupied by others,  ', '', 'but for which he is equally capacitated.  Yes, Mr. Chair- ', '', 'man, the principles of this blessed society seek the entire  ', '', 'extermination of that cruel, unnatural and awfully wicked  ', '', 'proscription, which turns away from the useful arts,  ', '', 'and from p[l]aces of profit and responsibility; and closes  ', '', 'up from us the sources of useful knowledge.  O! this  ', 'heartless prejudice!  I stand here a victim of its power.   ', 'Yes, sir, I stand here this evening a victim of this wither- ', '', 'ing, soul-killing prejudice.  What might I not have been  ', '', 'now, if I had been permitted to follow the guidance of  ', '', 'my desires.  I was impressed with the idea, that the  ', '', 'great Author of my being, had intrusted to me a mind  ', '', 'which I felt it my duty and privilege to cultivate; I gain-'], ['  ed admission to the seminary found[e]d by the denomina- ', '', 'tion of my own choice, located at Middletown, Conn.; I  ', '', 'rejoiced in view of the prospect which spread out before  ', '', 'me, of a favorable opportunity of acquiring that moral  ', '', 'and intellectual cultivation, requisite to the responsible  ', '', 'work of the holy ministry; but alas! alas! how did my  ', '', 'heart sink within me, when I first discovered that even  ', 'in my supposed retreat from the world and its persecu- ', 'tions, the monster was exercising his murderous influ- ', '', 'ence. ', '   Mr. Chairman, I have not language justly to portray  ', '', 'the emotions that agitated my lacerated bosom, when by  ', '', 'the repelling influence of prejudice exerci[s]ed by my ', 'sup- ', 'posed ﬁChristian brethren,ﬂ', ' and fellow students, I was  ', 'compelled to abandon the University, and with it all hope  ', '', 'of acquiring a liberal education; for I then found the col- ', 'leges throughout the land closed against me.  In an in- ', 'stant all my fond hopes were blasted.  The only conso- ', '', 'lation I found in this dark hour, was in pouring my sor- ', '', 'rows into the bosom of the God of the poor and oppress- ', '', 'ed.  But a new day has dawned upon us.  Since the ef- ', '', 'forts of the American Anti-Slavery Society, new and  ', '', 'powerful motives have been hung out, as it were from  ', '', 'heaven, beckoning us onward and upward, in every thing  ', '', 'useful and ennobling.  The doors of literary institutions  ', 'have been thrown open.  Facilities are every day increas- ', 'ing, for affording our sons and daughters such physical,  ', '', 'intellectual and moral training, as shall prepare them to  ', '', 'set their part with usefulness to society. ', '', '   Mr. Chairman, the sentiment expressed in this resolu- ', '', 'tion, ﬁThat the principles and measures of the American  ', '', 'Anti-Slavery Society have a practical illustration, in the'], ['  presentation of new and powerful motives to that class of  ', '', 'our fellow citizens more particularly identified with the  ', '', 'enslaved, for efforts for their improvement,ﬂ is true to the  ', '', 'letter.'], ['    Mr. Remond, on rising to address the company,  ', 'was loudly cheered.  That he felt deeply (he said) the  ', '', 'honor they were inclined to bestow by assembling  ', '', 'on the present occasion, he needed not to express,  ', '', 'and he hoped that his appreciation of the demonstra- ', '', 'tion so far as regarded himself, might be verified in  ', '', 'another way than words.  The temperance and an- ', '', 'ti-slavery reformations were two of the most popu- ', 'lar subjects of agitation of the day, on which mere  ', 'fine speeches were little, but he hoped if his life  ', '', 'was spared to be able to show his appreciation of  ', '', 'their kindness by his conduct, not only with regard  ', '', 'to temperance and slavery, but with regard to every  ', '', 'other cause which had for its object the good of his  ', '', 'fellow-creatures.  (Cheers.)  The temperance cause  ', '', 'was not new to him, although he had never joined  ', '', 'but one temperance society in his own country, but  ', 'he believed, that conduct was of much more conse- ', 'quence than profession, in this, as well as in other  ', '', 'matters, and he could with sincerity avow, that he  ', '', 'was a warm friend of the temperance movement.   ', '', 'In the United States, the anti-slavery cause and the  ', '', 'temperance cause were almost synonymous.  It was  ', '', 'true that many supported the temperance cause who  ', '', 'were not abolitionists, but there were no abolition- ', '', 'ists who were not likewise friends of the cause of  ', 'temperance.  (Cheers.)  The abolitionists of Ameri- ', 'ca felt interested in the temperance cause for many  ', '', 'reasonsŠas friends of suffering humanity, of good  ', '', 'morals, and of the good of society in general; but  ', '', 'when they learned, likewise, that intemperance had  ', '', 'been one of the chief supports of slavery in that  ', '', 'country, then they felt doubly strong in their indig-'], [' nation at the venders of such an article.  The tem- ', 'perance cause had made rapid progress in the Unit- ', '', 'ed States, but there was much yet to be done in that  ', '', 'country, and a great deal more to be done in this.   ', '', '(Hear, hear.)  The slave trade on the coast of Afri- ', '', 'ca was sustained by ardent spirits.  Where could  ', '', 'they find a man not excited by the use of ardent  ', '', 'spirits, who could lay his hand on innocent man,  ', 'woman, or child, fasten fetters upon them, and con- ', 'sign to all the horrors of a middle passage?  Where  ', '', 'could they find a man, even for filthy lucre, who  ', '', 'would be disposed to throw into the sea an entire  ', '', 'cargo of human beings, when pursued by British  ', '', 'cruisers, if they had not indulged in the use of ar- ', '', 'dent spirits, and were thus rendered reckless in the  ', '', 'commission of the most atrocious crimes?  That  ', '', 'he had at one time disposed of ardent spirits, he  ', 'would regret till the day of his death, and he would  ', 'make any sacrifice, if he could stand there and say  ', '', 'he had never been engaged in dealing in that arti- ', '', 'cle, the cause of so much misery and war.  He felt  ', '', 'borne down with the view of the amount of intem- ', '', 'perance in his own country and in this, and he  ', '', 'hoped they had come there that night determined to  ', '', 'carry forward the great work of temperance.  (Loud  ', '', 'cheers.)  A great change was going on in America  ', 'on this question, and it would do more if it should  ', 'succeed, to benefit not only the slave, but society in  ', '', 'general, than any other question that could be agi- ', '', 'tated there at this time.  (Cheering.)  In order to  ', '', 'carry it into full effect, they must have the co-opera- ', '', 'tion of England.  The notice of such a meeting as  ', '', 'that would have a vast effect on the other side of'], [' the Atlantic.  It was known to the most of them  ', 'that when temperance commenced there, it was  ', '', 'very unpopular indeed, but what had been the result  ', '', 'of that agitation?  Hundreds of societies had been  ', '', 'formed, the decrease in the consumption of ardent  ', '', 'spirits had been immense, thousands had ceased to  ', '', 'deal in the article, many distilleries had been stop- ', '', 'ped, and the capital employed in them turned into  ', 'better, and he hoped as profitable channels of manu- ', 'facturers or commerce.  (Cheers.)  The time was  ', '', 'not distant, he hoped, when the temperance cause  ', '', 'would become the great enterprise of the day, and  ', '', 'he hoped they would make up their mind so firmly  ', '', 'and fully, that no threats or influence would be suf- ', '', 'ficient to deter them from being faithful laborers in  ', '', 'the cause of temperance, and chase from the face of  ', '', 'society in this country, as well as the United States,  ', 'the last vestige of intemperance.  After noticing  ', 'the shocking scenes which were so frequently ex- ', '', 'hibited on the streets, and which were the result of  ', '', 'the use of ardent spirits, he referred to the immense  ', '', 'number of public houses on the roads of Scotland,  ', '', 'where almost nothing could be got by the traveller  ', '', 'but whiskey; and concluded this part of his address  ', '', 'by reading ‚The Drunkard™s Will.™  Mr. R. then  ', '', 'turned the attention of the meeting to the subject of  ', 'American slavery.  He showed the unfounded na- ', 'ture of the prejudice which existed in that country  ', '', 'against the entire free colored population.  They  ', '', 'were told, he said, that the colored man was only fit  ', '', 'to be a slave and servant, and while they were con- ', '', 'tent to continue slaves, they were the finest fellows  ', '', 'in the world; but when they would be men, when'], [' they would prove themselves industrious and sober  ', 'citizens, then they were considered almost unfit to  ', '', 'breathe in the same house with those whose sole  ', '', 'right to the possession of the privileges which  ', '', 'they enjoyed was founded on the principle that all  ', '', 'men were equal.  Mr. R. read extracts from an  ', '', 'American paper to show the way in which the eman- ', '', 'cipation of the West India slaves was celebrated by  ', 'the colored population of New-York, and the grate- ', 'ful and manly sentiments which they entertained to- ', '', 'wards those who had shown themselves attached to  ', '', 'the cause of humanity and justice.  After a long ad- ', '', 'dress on the same subject, he concluded by urging  ', '', 'upon the meeting to persevere in their endeavors to  ', '', 'emancipate the American slaves, as essential to the  ', '', 'destruction of that prejudice which was so baneful  ', '', 'to the happiness and true interests of the whole com- ', 'munity of the United States.  Mr. Remond resum- ', 'ed his seat amidst the most marked demonstrations  ', '', 'of applause.   ', '', '   The chairman said, if there was a single individ- ', '', 'ual in that meeting who entertained any doubt that  ', '', 'the colored man was not a human being, he would  ', '', 'not now need to consult the American slaveholder  ', '', 'on the subject, for he must be convinced that  ', '', 'Charles Remond was a man.  (Cheers.)  After a  ', 'few further remarks, the chairman concluded by an- ', 'nouncing a supply of fruit.  The company having  ', '', 'likewise been favored with a song from Mr. Water- ', '', 'son.'], ['   Mr. M. ROPER addressed the meeting, and stated a  ', 'number of facts which had come under his own know- ', '', 'ledge, demonstrative of the horrors and cruelties of Ame- ', '', 'rican slavery.  One case which he mentioned, was that of  ', '', 'a slave who occasionally preached to his fellow-bondsmen.   ', 'His master threatened that if he ever preached on the  ', 'Sabbath again, he would give him 500 lashes on the Mon- ', '', 'day morning.  He disobeyed the order, however, and  ', '', 'preached, unknown to his master.  He became alarmed, ', '', ' and ran away from Georgia, and crossed the river into South  ', '', 'Carolina, where he took refuge in a barn belonging to a  ', '', 'Mr. Garrison.  Mrs. Garrison saw him in the barn, and  ', '', 'informed her husband of it.  Mr. Garrison got his rifle  ', '', 'and shot at him.  The law required that they should call  ', 'upon the slave to stop three times before they fired at him;  ', 'Mr. Garrison called, but he did not stop.  The ball missed  ', '', 'him, and Mr. Garrison then struck him with the gun and  ', '', 'knocked him down.  The slave wrested it from him, and  ', '', 'struck him [Mr. G.] with it.  The slave was taken up for  ', '', 'it; his master went after him; Mr. Garrison purchased  ', '', 'him for 500 dollars, and burned him alive.'], ['   [ – The CHAIRMAN expressed a wish that the interim ', 'should be filled up by Mr. M. Roper™s stating some facts ', '', 'with which he was conversant. ', '', '   Considerable opposition was made to this suggestion. ', '', 'One gentleman exclaimed, ﬁMr. Roper is Dr. Cox™s ', 'pro- ', 'tege.ﬂ  Another gentleman rose and pertinaciously per- ', 'sisted in attempting to address the meeting.

', '', '   The Rev. A. FLETCHER stated that when Mr. Roper  ', '', 'was brought over into this country, he came with a letter ', 'of introduction to him, and had since been supported by ', 'some other ministers. ', '', '   A GENTLEMAN, whose name we could not learn, said ', '', 'that Dr. Cox bore a part in the expense of Mr. Roper™s  ', '', 'education.  (Hear, hear, and faint applause.)] ', '', '   Mr. ROPER then stood forward, and observed with con- ', '', 'siderable warmth, that Dr. Cox did pay a portion towards  ', '', 'his education, but that should not hinder him from advo- ', '', 'cating the cause of his mother, brethren, and sisters, now  ', 'in bondage.  (Loud cheers.)  He was grateful to Dr. Cox  ', 'for that which he was doing for him; but at the same time  ', '', 'his principles were not to be bought.  (Cheers.)  There was  ', '', 'not a Christian Society in America, which did not hold  ', '', 'slaves, except the Society of Friends.  (Cheers.)  In Salem,  ', '', 'a town in South Carolina, containing perhaps 20,000  ', '', 'Quakers, there was not a single slave, though they were  ', '', 'surrounded by a slave-holding population.  (Cheers.)  He  ', '', 'had run away from his master, and was going to see his  ', 'mother in North Carolina.  He had to pass through the  ', 'town of Salisbury, where there was a Quaker in gaol who'], ['was to be executed on the following Friday, for having  ', 'given a slave a free pass.  (Shame, shame.)  Mr. Thompson  ', '', 'had given them an account of some bad slaveholders; he  ', '', '(Mr. R.) would tell them of some good ones.  A master  ', '', 'with whom he once lived, Mr. Beveridge, in travelling  ', 'from Apalache to Columbia, having to pass through the  ', 'Indian nations, it was necessary for him to take arms.  He  ', '', 'was taken exceedingly ill, and could neither stand up nor  ', '', 'sit down.  He had a truck with him containing 20,000 dol- ', '', 'lars, and he (Mr. R.) took the pistols and protected his  ', '', 'master and his master™s property.  When he arrived at  ', '', 'Columbia, his master becoming embarrassed in circum- ', '', 'stances, sold him on a block; that was his kindness to him  ', '', '(Mr. R.) for saving his master™s life and protecting his  ', 'property.  Another good master was Colonel M™Gillion, a  ', 'Scotchman, who held about 300 slaves, and who used to  ', '', 'boast that he never flogged them.  His mode of punishing  ', '', 'them was to get a rice hogshead, into which several nails  ', '', 'were driven about a quarter of an inch through, and the  ', '', 'slaves then being fasten in, he used to roll them down a  ', '', 'very steep hill.  (Shame, shame.)  At one of the Revival  ', '', 'meetings, (of which he had heard so much since he came  ', '', 'to this country,) two ladies of colour came in and took  ', 'their seats in the pew for inquirers.  Holding down their  ', 'heads, they were not observed; but some ladies coming in,  ', '', 'and noticing their colour, left the pew directly.

', '   Feeling a deep interest for our shorn race, and confiding in the promises ', '', 'of those with whom he had been so long, and so firmly united by the strong, ', 'though tender cords of sympathy and friendship for each other and outraged human ', 'nature,Šthat the claims of humanity were so deeply interesting, that the idea of ', '', 'personal interest was never sufficiently regarded on the part of their Secretary ', 'to effect a positive understanding, as to what the Society would consider ', 'a just remuneration as salary for time and labor which he was called to bestow, ', 'until the 27', 'th of November, 1838, when the opacity which effects his vision ', 'compelled the Secretary earnestly to press upon the notice of the Society the ', '', 'importance of their naming a definite sum, and effecting an early settlement, that ', 'he might possess adequate means to settle his business, and retire for a season ', 'from the exciting field of labor, to a state of quiet in Paris, where he was ', '', 'persuaded by his physician and friends that he could find permanent relief from ', 'the threatening malady.  At the meeting referred to, the subject of a settlement ', 'with the Secretary was taken up and discussed by eight of the members of the ', '', 'Executive Committee.  But they decided to remunerate their Secretary with a  ', 'salary at the rate of $400 per annum, for two and a half years labor.  Though ', 'I felt disappointed and dissatisfied at the manner in which the subject was ', 'treated, knowing that the Committee had employed Rev. C. Turner on a salary ', 'at the rate of $600 per annum, exclusive of his travelling expenses, and a  ', '', 'commission of 20 per cent on all moneys by him collected over a certain sum, for ', 'performing the duties of financial agent only. ', '   The dissatisfaction was not entertained in my mind, from the fact, that the ', '', 'Society awarded the Financial Agent compensation equal at least to $1,000 per ', 'annum for his services, but from a sense of manifest injustice towards their ', 'Secretary, who had the honor of performing the labor of General Agent, Financial ', 'Agent, and Secretary, until he was compelled to yield to the infirmity which has ', 'been produced and encouraged in his eyes by the mental and physical excitement ', '', 'to which he has been subjected by the performance of his arduous duties. ', '  The Treasurer of the Committee was requested to settle with the Secretary, ', 'on their own terms.  After Mr. Johnston, the Treasurer, examined his ', 'accounts, he ', 'reported on paper so J. W. Higgins, Esq., the amount which he believed to be'], ['  due, exclusive of the sums which the Secretary had received as salary. ', '   As a difference of opinion existed between the Treasurer and myself as to the ', 'correctness of his report, a part only of the amount reported to be due was paid ', '', 'by a promissory note, from J. W. Higgins, dated December 4', 'th, 1838.  The ', 'Secretary feeling deeply interested at the Treasurer™s manifest inability to render ', 'a correct account, offered to render him every assistance in his power. ', '', '   The misunderstanding was in relation to the amount which the Treasurer had ', 'paid to the Secretary as salary, to January 1838.  In December, my friend, Mr. ', 'Williams, who had kindly tendered me a free passage to Europe, departed, leaving ', 'me behind.  The matter to which I shall call your attention in connection with the ', 'expence of the libel suit, became more and more interesting.  A part of my salary ', '', 'was to be appropriated to defray the expenses of the suit in which we were ', 'involved.  Finally, the Treasurer rashly ventured to assume, that he had even paid ', 'the Secretary the amount which he acknowledged to be due.  Of course the ', '', 'terms of a settlement became ', 'exceedingly', ' interesting. ', '   Secondly', 'ŠThe ﬁLIBEL SUIT,ﬂ and the ﬁCOLORED AMERICAN.ﬂ ', '   The course pursued by some of the members of the Committee, with the  ', '', 'editor of the ﬁColored American,ﬂ was mean, puerile and contemptible.  The ', 'matter was made a pretext to affect the Secretary, in relation to an affair with the ', 'Rev. T. S. Wright, which did not concern the ﬁColored American,ﬂ nor the ', 'Society.  The facts in relation to the suit are as follows:ŠThe ﬁLibel Suitﬂ ', 'grew out of the publication of Mr. Gavino™s letter, which appeared in the ', '', 'ﬁColored American,ﬂ in October, 1837; in which Mr. Gavino communicated ', 'certain facts in relation to the fate of three native Africans, who were enticed ', 'from on board the brig Governor Temple, of Gambier, in the fall of 1836, and ', '', 'sent to the south on board the vessel Robert Center, where Mr. Gavino states that ', 'they were cruelly treated, and that efforts were made to reduce them to slavery. ', 'Mr. Gavino having interfered in their behalf, was compelled to leave the vessel at ', '', 'New Orleans, with the Africans, where they were exposed to the mercy of their ', 'avaricious inveiglers.  Mr. Gavino™s letter was dated New Orleans, January, ', '1837, and directed to ﬁDavid Ruggles, Secretary of the New-York Committee of ', 'Vigilance.ﬂ  The facts were so roughly stated, that the Committee declined ', 'publishing the letter in their Annual Report, published in January, 1837, but  ', '', 'referred to the facts, which may be read on page 33 of the Report.  After Mr. G. ', 'returned to this city in August, 1837, he was called upon by a member of the ', 'Committee at 22 Rosevelt-street, where his letter was revised, and sent to the ', '', 'editor of the ﬁColored American,ﬂ by the Secretary of the Committee of Vigilance, ', 'and was published at the time referred to.  The person implicated in having ', 'shipped the Africans by stratagem, and forced them on board the vessel, sued the ', '', 'Secretary of the Committee of Vigilance, the editor, publisher and printer of the'], ['  Colored American, for publishing against him a libel.  A meeting of the members ', 'of the Committee of Vigilance was invited at the corner of Hudson and Broome ', 'streets, for the purpose of taking measures to defend the suit; three members ', '', 'only, (who formed a quorum, however,) attended the meeting, viz.ŠT. S. Wright, ', 'William Johnston, and David Ruggles.  They decided, after examining the case, ', 'that it was the duty of the Committee to defend the persons who were involved, ', '', 'by sustaining the expense of the suit, and authorized the Secretary of the Com- ', 'mittee to engage R. & T. Sedgwick, Esqrs., as counsel in the case, in behalf of ', 'the New-York Committee of Vigilance.  A note was accordingly addressed to ', 'them, soliciting their professional services in the suit.  In the Report of the ', 'Committee, published in January, 1838, the libel suit is particularly referred to.Š ', '', 'From that period to the 15', 'th October, 1838, the libel suit was defended and ', 'sustained by authority, and at the expense of the NEW-YORK COMMITTEE OF ', 'VIGILANCE.  The expense of the suit in July was $45.00, and was paid on the  ', '', '11th by the Committee.  The cost of the suit in October, was $65.25, which was ', 'paid by the ', 'New-York Committee of Vigilance', ', independent of the expense of ', 'subpening witnesses from time to time in behalf of the defendants.  The case ', '', 'was tried on the 15', 'th of October, and the verdict was against the defendants, ', 'owing, as was generally believed, and as the Colored American informed its ', 'readers, to ', 'prejudice', ' in the ', 'jury-box', '.  I have not the least doubt that the name ', 'ﬁDavid Ruggles,ﬂ being so odious at that time to the minds of the jury, from the ', 'false statements by the commercial press in relation to the ﬁ', 'Darg case', ',ﬂ was the ', 'main ground upon which the verdict was rendered against us.  Subsequent to the  ', '15th of October, a meeting of the Committee was held at 18 Liberty-street, for ', 'the purpose of adopting measures to defray the expense of the ', 'Libel Suit', 'Š present, George M. Tracy, William P. Johnson, J. W. Higgins, T. S. Wright, ', 'S. E. Cornish, and the Secretary.  G. M. Tracy in the chair.  It was voted that ', 'the committee should ', 'raise the necessary means to pay the expense of the Libel', ' Suit.  ', 'S. E. Cornish, George M. Tracy, W. Johnston, T. S. Wright, and J. W. ', 'Higgins, were appointed a committee to collect the sum required. For this ', 'purpose, appeals were made to the public through the columns of the Colored ', 'American, which were responded to by our friends in this city, in Rochester, in ', 'Pittsburg, in Ohio, and in other parts of the country, who sent their donations to ', '', 'extricate the Committee of Vigilance, and the Colored American from the un- ', 'righteous responsibility in which we were involved.  Meeting after meeting was ', 'held in this city, by the Committee, and attended by their friends, many of whom ', '', 'are present.  The last public meeting upon the subject was held on the 20', 'th of ', 'November, and addressed by James G. Birney, S. E. Cornish, Wm. Johnston, ', 'T. S. Wright, and J. W. Higgins, in behalf of the Committee of Vigilance, and ', '', 'a collection taken up and pledges received, to aid the Society in defraying the'], ['  expenses of ', 'their', ' LIBEL SUIT. ', '   About this time, or soon after, T. S. Wright and myself had trouble, about ', 'which you have already heard too muchŠwhere all the humbugs and crickets, and ', '', 'other ﬁ', 'blundering', 'ﬂ things were hatched from five to seven years of age, which ', 'has enabled the editor of the Colored American to furnish his readers with so ', 'much interesting matter n connection with my name.  The clouds collected thick ', '', 'and blackŠthe lightning flashedŠthe thunders rolledŠthe storm threatened instant ', 'annihilation.  So a caucus meeting of the Committee of Vigilance, was gotten ', 'up on the 11', 'th January last, in the absence, and without the knowledge of the ', 'Secretary, who was ', 'then', ' and ', 'there', ' accused, arraigned, denounced, ', 'calumniated', ', and ', 'condemned, as he has been informed, in a manner too shocking to relate.Š ', '', 'Mr. Cornish expressed his suspicions, Mr. Johnston expressed his convictionsŠ ', 'Mr. Wright confirmed their opinions, and laughed in his sleeveŠhe could not ', 'now remember that the Secretary was authorized at the meeting referred to in ', '', 'October 1837, to employ counsel to defend the Libel suit.  Mr. Johnston ventured ', 'to assume that the suit did not belong to the New-York Committee of Vigilance, ', 'and it was placed upon the head of David Ruggles, where it has remained from that ', '', 'period to the present, although my letter to G. M. Tracy, Esq., President of the ', 'New-York Committee of Vigilance, resigning the office of Secretary and Agent ', 'is dated January 12', 'th, 1839.  I had no knowledge of the dark proceedings of ', 'the caucus meeting referred to, until after the 19', 'th of January, when the editor ', 'of the Colored American, assassin like, believing as he remarks in his paper, ', '', 'that his victim was ﬁ', 'on his back', ',ﬂ reached over the committee in an article ', 'under the caption ﬁ', 'The Libel Suit', ',ﬂ and stabbed me.  He informed the ', 'public that the Libel Suit neither belonged to the Committee of Vigilance nor to ', '', 'the Colored American, but to David Ruggles, or to ', 'Ruggles & Russell', '.  He ', 'then (consistent with Arnoldism,) bid for a bribe, by pledging himself to the public ', 'to ﬁhave nothing to do withﬂ his brethren, (RŠs and RŠl,) if they would ', '', 'send him a few dollars.  Although I had been informed on a particular ', 'occasion by the Rev. T. S. Wright, that the Libel suit would be made a personal ', 'matter to effect my reputation, I had no suspicion that the editor of the ', 'Colored American had taken so deep a part in the tragedy, until after he exposed ', 'my confidential letter to him, expressing grief and surprise at his course, and ', '', 'stating some facts, explaining reasons why I could not contribute more towards ', 'defraying the expense of the Libel Suit.  The letter referred to is marked No. 1,  ', 'and reads thus:Š'], ['                                                                                         Office, 36 Lispenard Street, ', '', '                                                                                         New-York, Jan. 19, 1839. ', '   REV. S. E. CORNISHŠ ', '      Dear SirŠThis comes to you from a ', 'deeply injured', ' and afflicted friend. ', '      How could you publish the innuendo against me, that appears in the ', 'ﬁColored Americanﬂ of to-day, after stating as I did my case to Mr. Bell, the ', 'other day, who doubtless informed you and Mr. S. of my embarrassment for want ', '', 'of means!  I think, sir, that you evince an ', 'anti-christian spirit', ', by reaching over ', 'the Committee to stab me.

In William Johnston I am deceived!'], ['    MR. CHAIRMAN ', ' Sir, Mr. Johnson appears here, as is evident from his speech,  ', 'as a deeply interested witness ', ' bearing testimony against me for himself, for his  ', 'pastor the Rev. T. S. Wright, for the ﬁCommittee of Vigilance,ﬂ for the ﬁland  ', 'speculators,ﬂ and for Tom, Dick and Harry, to prove me responsible in the Libel  ', '', 'Suit.  I consider Mr. Johnson™s testimony in this case, where he testifies to the  ', '', 'negative', ' testimony of T. S. Wright and William Johnston, concerning the meeting  ', 'which was held in October, 1837, at the corner of Hudson and Broome streets, of  ', 'infinite importance, because it establishes my position beyond question.  He admits  ', '', 'that Wright and Johnston attended the meeting, but that they do not now recollect  ', '', 'having authorised the Secretary to employ counsel to defend the suit.  Now I hold  ', 'that the negative testimony of twenty witnesses in a case is good for nothing, when  ', 'the positive testimony of one witness establishes the fact. ', '', '   I affirm, in the case of the Libel Suit, that the Committee authorised the Se- ', 'cretary to employ counsel to defend the suit.  Mr. Johnson denies that the meeting  ', 'which was held on the 11', 'th Jan. at 217 William-st., was a caucus meeting.  I regret  ', 'that he does not understand the character of a caucus meeting: if he does, I cannot  ', '', 'conceive how he can possess effrontery to deny, that the meeting to which I have  ', 'referred was one of the most contemptible caucus meetings that was ever held by  ', 'any Society; I was Secretary of the Society at the time, and the meeting was  ', '', 'gotten up without my knowledge by certain treacherous members, to arraign me.  I  ', 'pronounce the meeting a caucus, because they neglected ', ' intentionally too ', ' to  ', 'invite all parties concerned.  Now, sir, the ﬁ', 'family', ' affair', 'ﬂ to which Mr. Johnson  ', 'has referred, is, in my opinion too delicate a matter for the public to scan.  As Mr.  ', 'Wright has furnished the public with his version of the tale, I regret that he is not  ', 'present to help his representative out, as it appears to be interesting, and very much  ', '', 'to the point, in proving me ﬁreckless of principleﬂ in the business of the Libel suit.   ', 'Since the Rev. Theodore S. Wright and his friend have manifested so much regard  ', 'for the reputation of the defenceless party, by exposing letters and making the  ', '', 'affair a matter of public notoriety, it is proper I should state, that the ﬁfamily  ', '', 'affairﬂ grew out of an honorable correspondence between myself and the defence- ', 'less party.  As the consent of the guardian had been obtained by the parties, to  ', 'continue the correspondence, it was not supposed that the match-making step  ', '', 'father would have interfered on the ground that I am not a clergyman.  My ad- ', '', 'versary knows that this affair is the very acorn of the umbrageous tree that shades'], ['  us all ', ' under which the gallows is erected and the pit is dug! ', ' where it is de- ', 'creed that the ﬁblundering youthﬂ must be ', 'executed and ', 'buried', ', without trial or  ', 'benefit of ', 'CLERGY', ', nolens volens. ', '   The land business to which Mr. Johnson has called your attention, which  ', 'has been like most speculations, an unfortunate affair for all concerned, is another  ', '', 'matter as irrelevant to the business of this meeting as would be his own private  ', '', 'family affairs, or the business between himself and his creditors.  As Mr. Cornish  ', 'has remarked upon the ﬁland speculatorsﬂ in No. 104 of the Colored American, and  ', 'as there appears to be a disposition to drag the matter up here, permit me to state,  ', '', 'that it has no more to do with the ﬁ', 'Libel Suit', ',ﬂ the ﬁColored American,ﬂ or the  ', 'com of Vigilance, than the Revds. Samuel E. Cornish, C. B. Ray, and Theodore S.  ', 'Wright™s Newark lot speculations had to do with the speculations of the clergy in  ', 'the moon.  Mr. Wright has manifested such an indomitable penchant to obtain  ', '', 'matter from any and every quarter to effect me, that in March last, as I am in- ', '', 'formed, at the house of Henry Davis, where a meeting of the Union Land Co. was  ', 'held, he remarked in an emphatic tone, ﬁBrethren, if Mr. Ruggles ', 'swims', ' we must  ', 'sink', '!  He has sent a letter to brother Cornish, bidding us all defiance ', ' if there is  ', 'anything against him here, we must have it!ﬂ  The simple facts in relation to the  ', 'Land Company are as follows.  The Rev. Mr. Ray and myself, in 1836, agreed to  ', '', 'participate in land speculation; accordingly sixty lots were purchased in my name  ', 'in New Haven.  He got up the company, who ', 'refused', ' $6000 for their lots. ', '  Before the first installment was paid, Mr. Ray ', 'backed out, and some others with  ', 'him.  The pressure of ™37 came ', ' and confidence left the company.  In 1838  ', 'the mortgage threatened to foreclose upon us, and those who should have been  ', 'peace-makers have stirred up and encouraged strife.  Mr. Edward V. Clark can  ', '', 'testify to Mr. Ray™s course in that business.   ', '', '   Mr. J. inquires why I did not add the names F. Chatfield and M. Strong.  I  ', 'can add them, with those of Messrs. Johnson and Landryne, who are mem- ', 'bers of Mr. Wright™s congregation, and are subject to his clerical dictation. ', '  Since I have detected the treachery of Revds. Samuel E. Cornish, T. S. Wright,  ', 'and C. B. Ray, in relation to the ﬁLand Speculators,ﬂ I consider them three of  ', '', 'the most dangerous clerical ', 'wolves', ' that ever appeared in sheep™s clothing.   ', '   My difficulty with Mr. Van Rensalaer commenced with his course towards my  ', 'friend J. W. Higgins, or the firm J. W. & D. Higgins, who were also ﬁsatisfied with'], ['  me.ﬂ  I became bail for Mr. V., who was accused with assaulting his neighbor.  On  ', '', 'the day of the trial he left this city for New Jersey, and on his return was arrested and  ', 'committed, until his pastor, the Rev. Mr. Wright, succeeded in obtaining his libera- ', 'tion.  His excuse for deserting his bail was, that I was a minor, and could not be  ', '', 'injured.  The attempt which Weaver made upon Messrs. Patterson, Gustin and  ', '', 'myself, before he decamped from the city, entitles him to the character of a fugi- ', 'tive from justice.    ', '   Sir, this representative of the Committee of Vigilance, Mr. Johnson, admits  ', 'the whole matter at issue ', ' that the ﬁLibel Suitﬂ belongs to the Society; that  ', 'they paid the money, and that $400 per annum was not just compensation.  Hear  ', 'him ', ' ﬁI know that his', ' services were worth', ' MORE', ', and ', 'SO DID THE COMMITTEE', ' (!)  ', 'We all knew that his services were ', 'invaluable', '!ﬂ  Precious confession!  Why  ', 'did not the Committee confess ', 'judgment', ' and plead ', 'poverty', ' before!

His prime witness and swearing  ', '', 'representative, Mr. Bell, testifies that he was ﬁgoaded onﬂ to the ﬁ', 'attack', 'ﬂ proving  ', 'malice in his heart.  How can the double-dealing, priest-ridden goat stand mum  ', 'and see me exterminated on account of $17 50, when he heard the Treasurer  ', '', 'admit before J. W.

(Cheers.)'], ['    Mr. Smith, a young gentlemen of color,  ', 'moved the second resolution, and in doing  ', '', 'so could not but congratulate the society on  ', '', 'the success which had already crowned their  ', '', 'labors.  In adverting to the efforts made by  ', '', 'the society for the suppression of the slave  ', '', 'trade, he remarked, that all exertions yet  ', '', 'made had perhaps only tended to make the  ', 'condition of the unhappy slaves still more  ', 'miserable.  It had been proved in many in- ', '', 'stances that when slave ships were pursued  ', '', 'by the vessels employed to put an end to  ', '', 'that inhuman traffic, if the slave captains  ', '', 'saw themselves likely to fall into the hands  ', '', 'of their pursuers, they made no scruple of  ', '', 'throwing overboard the entire human cargo,  ', '', 'that they might be able to swear that they  ', 'had not a single slave on board.  Mr. Smith  ', 'then made some very judicious remarks on  ', '', 'slavery as it exists at present in the United  ', '', 'States, and the means which should be taken  ', '', 'to put an end to it.  According to the original  ', '', 'constitution of the U. States, Congress had  ', '', 'not the power to pass a law against slave- ', '', 'holding; but there was nothing to prevent  ', '', 'them from putting an end to the traffic in  ', 'slaves, and if Congress would be induced  ', 'to pass a law for that purpose, slavery would  ', '', 'soon die a natural death.  In conclusion, he  ', '', 'spoke of the labors of Mr. Thompson, who,  ', '', 'although he had done much in the cause,  ', '', 'would require to be assisted by others equal- ', '', 'ly devoted to it.'], ['    ﬁThe most brilliant era in the British parliament,  ', 'was that in which it contained the largest number of  ', '', 'finished scholars.  Pitt, and Fox, and Sheridan,  ', '', 'and that galaxy of genius were all of them distin- ', '', 'guished as learned in the ancient languages, and that  ', '', 'man who stands alone, and far above all the rest,  ', '', 'even in so distinguished an era, Edmund Burke,  ', '', 'made the classics his study to the latest period of  ', 'this life.  Later still ', ' Lord Brougham, even amid  ', 'those tremendous feats of intellectual labor, which  ', 'has gained for him the title of the man of iron,  ', '', 'found leisure and necessity to cultivate the classics.   ', '', 'And I have been told by my friend Sir Daniel Sand[-] ', '', 'ford, that when Lord B. was preparing that splen- ', 'did peroration to his speech in defence of the Queen  ', 'he locked himself up in his closet for a fortnight,  ', '', 'constantly studying over and over again, the most  ', '', 'powerful of the orations of Demosthenes, that con- ', '', 'cerning the crown.

', '', '   ﬁLet it be written on each man™s forehead, what  ', 'his opinion is regarding the republic.ﬂ'], ['    Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen', ':  I rise to offer a resolution expressive  ', 'of our high satisfaction in the noble efforts of the abolitionists of Great Britain and  ', 'France, who, although they are separated from us by the width of an ocean, and  ', 'by distinct political institutions, are nevertheless united with us in sentiment and  ', 'exertion in the scared cause of immediate and universal emancipation: and, Sir,  ', 'whether we look at their position amongst the nations of the earth, the principles  ', 'by which they seem actuated, or the measures which, in this cause, they have  ', '', 'adopted, we have abundant reason to rejoice, and cannot but be thankful to Him  ', 'who hath raised up for us in our time of need such devoted and efficient coad- ', 'intors. ', '   With these two nations we are connected by ties of the closest amity, and en- ', 'joy greater reciprocal influence than with any others upon the globe. To these  ', 'nations our struggle for independence gave the first impulse to the path of liberty,  ', '', 'which, if they have trod with slower, they have trod with more consistent steps  ', 'than we: for every step they have advanced, each measure they have gained, has  ', 'been an advantage not only to themselves, but to all who are dependant on them.   ', 'And whenever the people of Great Britain or of France have attained any portion  ', 'of civil liberty, their first exercise of it has been to extend the precious boon to  ', '', 'their fellow-subjects, held in the galling chains of West Indian Slavery.  In the  ', 'last century, the first Convention elected by the French people, immediately  ', 'abolished slavery in two French colonies: and in the present, the passing of the  ', '', 'British Reform Bill, has rapidly been followed by the abolition of British West In- ', 'dian slavery.  France, indeed, set the first, the most glorious and most instructive  ', 'example.  It was the most glorious example, because liberty was conferred with- ', '', 'out stint or restriction, without any lengthened delay to sicken hope, or purgato- ', 'rial state to blast expectation; it was sudden and entire: the man who until  ', 'yesterday had toiled in the field, and had known no other incentive to labor than  ', 'the cartwhip, was to-day raised to the dignity and privileges of a citizen of the  ', 'republic; the woman who until yesterday had sobbed over her youngling, and  ', '', 'besought the grave to snatch it from the horror of existence, to-day held it to- ', 'wards the skies, and shrieked, He is free! ', '   The example has proved most instructive, for when France again bent her  ', '', 'neck to the iron yoke of a ruthless tyrant, and suffered her sons to be slaughtered  ', 'at the altar of ambitious despotism, the men whom she had so suddenly liberated  ', '[were] themselves worthy of their freedom; for, against the veterans of Europe™s  ', '', '[annexation] against an armament sent out by the empire which overwhelmed Na- ', '[tions amidst] the loathing and scorn of a neighboring republic, and the cold and  ', '[awful tempest] of all nations, they have maintained their freedom, until now, when  ', '[amiable] and consistent France, inspired with the genius of modern abolitionism,  ', '[acknowledging] the independence of Hayti, completes the triumph which revo-'], ['  lutionary France began.  France, then, has been the first to grant [immediate]  ', 'and entire emancipation, and the first to acknowledge the right and capacity of a  ', '', 'community of freemen to rank among the nations of the earth.  And although  ', 'she (France) still holds 260,000 slaves in some of her dependencies, yet recent  ', 'movements nearly akin to her pristine efforts, promise these a speedy liberation.   ', '', 'At the session of 1837, M. Passy gave notice to the French Chamber of Deputies,  ', 'that he would, in the ensuing session, bring forward, and take occasion to discuss,  ', 'the question of emancipation of those slaves.  When the next session arrived,  ', 'that gentleman, in the fulfilment of his promise, brought forward a resolution to  ', 'the effect that the children of slaves born after the promulgation of an act for the  ', '', 'purpose should be free.  After an able and interesting debate, which involved the  ', 'whole question of slavery, not only was this resolution  adopted, but the Deputies  ', 'seemed very desirous that the gentleman should go still further, and propose a  ', '', 'measure that might strike nearer to the root of the evil.  M. Passy is the Vice  ', 'President of the French Abolition Society, an association, by the way, which al- ', 'most owes its existence to the remonstrances of the Glasgow Emancipation So- ', '', 'ciety; and who can imagine the joy of his heart, when in presenting the resolu- ', 'tion to the Legislature, doubtful whether they would even discuss the question to  ', 'which it related, he found them not only willing for discussion, not only adopting  ', 'his motion, but actually desirous to go beyond it!  There was some opposition,  ', 'certainly; and this, as usual, came from the ministry.  Strange what a link there  ', '', 'seems to be between ministry and slavery, that men in the possession of political  ', 'power are such warm advocates for the continuance of slavery Œ yet the resolution  ', 'passed, and the next session will probably witness a still more glorious move- ', '', 'ment in favor of abolition.  Sir, this transaction is one of the most cheering that  ', 'has occurred in the history of abolitionism.  For we here find a legislative body,  ', 'without any recurrence to the primary assemblies of the people, without being  ', '', 'urged by petitions or bound by pledges, without being incited by the tales of hor- ', 'ror that always accompany slavery, ', ' for it is a remarkable fact that the slaves of  ', 'Catholics are better fed and better treated than those of Protestants: I say we  ', 'find a legislative body without any of the ordinary inducements, at the first dis- ', '', 'cussion of the subject, not only adopting the measure proposed by the most san- ', 'guine of the abolitionists, but actually desirous of advancing still further.  This  ', 'was a manifestation of principle at which we may blush as Americans, but rejoice  ', '', 'as men: and unwilling as I am to utter any remark, or draw any comparison, ', 'reflecting even he slightest discredit on  ', '    ﬁMy own, my native land,ﬂ ', 'yet there is something in the facts, which, however humbling, may yet prove in- ', 'structive.  The very year that witnessed in your Hall of Representatives, the ap-'], ['  palling spectacle of a venerable man, hooted and howled at when he sought [even]  ', 'the right to petition in behalf of the slave, the same year beheld the legislature of  ', '', 'king-ridden, priest-ridden, and, as some say, infidel France, cheering on an aboli- ', 'tionist in his measures for emancipation. ', '   Mr. President, if we next turn our eyes toward Great Britain, on whose [domin- ', '', 'ions] the sun never sets, whilst they extend through every clime, we find [but a]  ', 'neighbor of almost every nation, and therefore capable of [influencing all and that]  ', 'influence is regulated by those sound principles for which she is so [justly pre- ', 'pared,] which are her shelter in the hour of danger, and her glory in the day of  ', 'prosperity.  Sound as these principles are on all other questions, they are pre-emi- ', '', 'nently so on that question which we are this day met to forward.  For if, unwit- ', 'tingly, the British people became deeply imbued in the blood-guiltiness of slavery  ', 'and the slave trade, yet as soon as they became aware of the enormity of the  ', '', 'crime, and possessed the power to remove it, they made signal and instantane- ', 'ous atonement by the immediate emancipation of their 800,000 slaves.  And this  ', 'great movement was distinguished by none of the bitterness of a political contest,  ', '', 'none of the selfishness of a political victory.  And when the battle was over and  ', 'the victory won, the men who had gained it ', ' the dissenters of England and Scot- ', 'land ', ' still heard the clank of chains, the groans of men, and the wail of women  ', 'held in slavery by other nations.  They heard these sounds, and they felt the  ', 'principles by which they had recently been stirred still glow within them, and  ', 'expand their benevolence beyond the limits of a single empire: they felt the force  ', 'of that sentiment uttered nearly a thousand years ago by an African slave ', ' Homo ', ' sum, humani nil alienum a me puto', '.  They felt that their country was the world,  ', 'their countrymen mankind, and were urged by motives that they could not resist  ', 'to make the attempt to disenthral all their countrymen: and they bound them- ', '', 'selves by solemn compact to begin a moral agitation that shall not cease until  ', 'the last fetter shall fall from the last slave upon our earth. ', '   They formed the British Society for the immediate and universal emancipation  ', 'of slaves, and the consequent destruction of the slave trade throughout the world.   ', '   Sir, what are the means by which they hope to obtain so glorious a result? ', '  The means are simple, but with God™s blessing, they will prove efficient.  With  ', 'the Bible in their hands, and its precepts for their guide, they are determined  ', 'calmly, but earnestly and incessantly, to remonstrate with all slaveholders, and  ', 'to beseech them to liberate their slaves. ', '', '   Their first effort was directed against slavery and the slave trade in our repub- ', 'lic.  They subsequently determined, by means of the same gifted and devoted  ', 'agent whom they had sent here, thoroughly to abolitionize Great Britain and Ire- ', '', 'land, in order that remonstrances might be sent from the great body of Chris-'], ['  tians of that empire, imploring the Christians of these United States to abolish  ', 'American Slavery.  Some of those remonstrances we have already received. ', '  And although, at the present time, their efforts are devoted to another and more  ', 'appropriate object, the entire abolition of the last vestige of slavery, which yet  ', 'lingers in their colonies under the name of apprenticeship, yet as soon as they have  ', 'abolished the apprenticeship system ', ' and they will do so, even if it be but one  ', 'hour sooner than its appointed expiration, yet they will obtain that hour, in order  ', 'that the principles of immediate emancipation may, in their colonies, vanquish  ', 'the chicanery of slavery in its very metamorphosis ', ' then, sir, with the renewed  ', 'zeal, the additional experience, and the force of the complete example which this  ', 'victory will give them, they will bring all their energies to bear upon slavery as  ', 'it exists in these states.  ', '', '   We may rejoice then, Sir, in the present efforts of the British abolitionists, on ac- ', 'count of the principle for which they are made.  It is a struggle for immediate  ', 'instead of gradual emancipation, and must, therefore, merit the sympathies, the  ', '', '[grand] wishes and the co-operation of all who are in favor of immediate emanci- ', 'pation.  We may rejoice in theirs efforts, on account of the proof which they give  ', 'to the world of the superiority, nay, the necessity of immediate instead of gradual  ', 'emancipation.  Should the apprenticeship, which works so badly, be [permitted] to  ', 'continue until 1840, the evils which have resulted, and the insurrection [which]  ', '', 'might arise from it, would be, to the slaveholder, an argument against emancipa- ', 'tion in any form, and to many friends of liberty, an argument for very [gradual]  ', 'emancipation.  The position in which the British abolitionists are now [placed]  ', '', 'must convince slaveholders that they must grant, and abolitionists that they must  ', 'obtain immediate emancipation, else they will be forced to ﬁfight their battle  ', 'o™er again.ﬂ   ', '', '   We may rejoice in these efforts, on account of the renewed zeal which they will  ', 'infuse into the abolition party of Great Britain; for it is the peculiar glory of abo- ', 'litionism, as well as of all moral enterprises, that contest whets the mind, and in- ', 'vigorates it for other and more difficult undertakings.  One moral victory gain- ', 'ed, raises the mind to an eminence whence it perceives others that must be achiev- ', '', 'ed, and inspires it with new energies for the struggle.  The British slave trade  ', 'being abolished, the British Anti-Slavery Society for Gradual Emancipation was  ', 'formed; from this, sprung the Society for Immediate Emancipation; this, as it  ', '', 'was thought, being obtained in the British Colonies, their (the abolitionists™) views  ', 'grew larger, their benevolence embraced the globe, and the Society for Immediate  ', 'and Universal Emancipation was the result ', ' and since, in this manner, each step  ', 'advanced has increased their zeal and enlarged their views, we ca', 'nnot doubt that  ', 'their present efforts will be attended with similar effects.  Indeed, sir, their pre-'], ['  sent exertions have not only increased the zeal of the abolitionists, but they have  ', 'added new and invaluable auxiliaries to their ranks.  The flame of abolitionism  ', '', 'is no longer confined to the dissenters of Great Britain; it has even penetrated  ', 'within the walls of the church established by law: and bishops of the church of  ', 'England have at length discovered that the advocacy of the cause of God™s suf- ', '', 'fering poor is not inconsistent with apostolic order.  Men of every rank and of  ', 'every sect are gathering around the standard of abolition, and they forget the ran- ', 'cor of party and the clashing of creeds in their common anxiety to disenthral the  ', 'slave; and the great principle from which this anxiety grows ', ' that of loving all  ', 'men ', ' is, imperceptibly to themselves, diffusing its healing influence over the hos- ', 'tile parties for once united; Dissenter and Churchman, Protestant and Papist,  ', 'standing on the broad platform of humanity and covered with the mantle of  ', 'charity, are beginning to love one another whilst united to manifest their com- ', '', 'mon love towards the crushed and bleeding slave.  And when the apprenticeship  ', 'is abolished, this mass of mind, animated by the principle which now unites it,  ', 'and in the exercise of the same, will devote its entire energies to the emancipa- ', '', 'tion of our slaves.  And the Christians of Great Britain will call upon those of  ', 'these states in one long and loud and incessant series of remonstrances, entreat- ', 'ing them to follow the British example.   ', '', '   Sir, I admire this method of remonstrance.  Judging from those we have al- ', 'ready received, they seem to be of the right tone, and calculated to effect much  ', 'good.  I deem the method of remonstrance right, b', 'ecause it is warranted by the  ', 'usages of nations in past and at the present time. In our own time, one govern- ', 'ment has frely remonstrated with another on the destruction of the African slave  ', 'trade; why, then, may not one people ', ' who are the source of all governmental  ', 'power ', ' remonstrate with another for the abolition of slavery?  The people of  ', '[these United] States, at least that very large and respectable portion of them which  ', '[perpetuated] the American Temperance Society, have remonstrated with the Brit- ', 'ish people on the sin of intemperance; have not the people of Britain an equal  ', '[right to] remonstrate with us on the equally heinous sin of slavery?   But, Sir, not  ', '', '[only] has remonstrance, in other words, moral interference, been sanctioned by  ', '[common] usage and our own practice, but British interference in our slave ques- ', 'tion has actually been solicited, and solicited too by all the good and the great of  ', 'our land, who are at this moment receiving pecuniary assistance from a few of the  ', 'British people for the abolition of American slavery by means of colonization. ', '  Can the good and the great complain then, if other British subjects, once solici- ', 'ted by the same agent, see fit to strive for the self-same object by remonstrating  ', '', 'with the slaveholder on the justice, safety and expediency of immediate eman-'], [' cipation? ', '   But, Sir, common usage may be wrong, the Temperance and even the Coloni- ', 'zation Society may be wrong in sanctioning national interference in national sins.   ', '', 'I still plead for the right of remonstrance on higher grounds than common usage,  ', 'or the sanction of moral reforming associations.  Christians are governed by the  ', 'laws peculiar to the commonwealth of Christ, and which are independent of mere  ', '', 'human laws imposed by human communities; the citizens of the Church Catholic  ', 'of the Redeemer may be spread through many climes and subject to various forms  ', 'of political government, but no difference in clime, no diversity in form of political  ', 'creed can break the links which makes them fellow-citizens in Christ, or free  ', 'them from obedience to the precepts of the Saviour.  One of these precepts is,  ', '', 'that they may rebuke one another in love; and another is, that they may exhort  ', 'each other to ﬁgood works.ﬂ  Reposing on these precepts and obedient to them,  ', 'the Christians of Britain have a right to call upon the Christians of these Untied  ', '', 'States to desist form the sin of slaveholding.  I have thus, Sir, imperfectly laid  ', 'before you a few reasons why we may rejoice in the noble efforts of the Abolition- ', 'ists of France and Great Britain.  Of the latter, after five years™ residence among  ', '', 'them, during all which time I was favored with a seat in their counsels and marked  ', 'their every movement, I may state it as my deliberate conviction that they are  ', 'actuated in this cause by the purest benevolence, and the most sound discretion.   ', 'And it is my firm belief that could their hearts be laid bare to inspection of  ', 'any southern slaveholder, he would find nothing there but Christian love toward  ', '', 'the master himself as well as toward his slave. ', '   Mr. President, the resolution which I hold in my hand, states that we not only  ', 'rejoice in the efforts of the trans-atlantic Abolitionists, but also pledge them our  ', '', 'co-operation in the cause.  Sir, in order to co-operate with them, we must not  ', 'only acknowledge their principles, we must also adopt their practice.  If we look  ', 'at the British example, we find that in their pursuit of the universal, they omit no  ', '', 'one of the particulars of which that universal is made up.  Their abolitionism is  ', 'thorough.  It began at home.  They first consecrated their own soil to liberty ', '  so that ﬁslaves cannot breatheﬂ thereon.  They next purified their colonies from  ', 'the stain of slavery.  Their principles now compel them, before they can call  ', '', 'upon other sovereign people for immediate emancipation, first to practice imme- ', 'diate emancipation themselves by abolishing the apprenticeship.  Mr. President,  ', 'are there no apprentices around you?  Are there not five hundred thousand ap- ', '', 'prentices to liberty not for one year or six years, but for a time not yet defined,  ', 'scattered throughout this and other states in which abolitionism almost reigns?   ', 'How then can we co-operate with Great Britain, how can we emulate her example,  ', 'unless we abolish the last vestiges of slavery in our own states before we send  ', 'our remonstrances to other sovereign states?  Or, how can we call upon the'], ['    For this enthusiastic wel- ', 'come, for the high and enviable honor which  ', '', 'you do me this day, and for the kind sympa- ', '', 'thy which you thus manifest towards me,  ', '', 'under peculiar and trying circumstances, I  ', 'return you my most sincere thanks.  I thank  ', 'you from my heart.  But, whilst I most  ', '', 'cordially reciprocate those sentiments of mu- ', '', 'tual regard which it has pleased you to ex- ', '', 'press towards me, it would be doing violence  ', '', 'to my own judgement, I would pay but a  ', '', 'poor compliment to you sagacity, if I regar- ', '', 'ded the flattering testimonial entirely as a  ', '', 'mark of personal esteem.  ForŠhowever  ', 'warm may have been the esteem which I  ', 'have had the honor of reciprocating with  ', '', 'you, for no short space of time, still that  ', '', 'could not have warranted you in offering, or  ', '', 'me in accepting, a tribute of respect which is  ', '', 'justly reserved for those who are highly dis- ', '', 'tinguished in some one of the pursuits of  ', '', 'life.  It is something unusual then, gentle- ', '', 'men, that has collected you round this fes- ', 'tive board.  It is to notice an eventŠthe  ', 'first of the kind that has ever happened in  ', '', 'your free and happy land.  O, may it be the  ', '', 'last!

The old adage is true, that ﬁsoft  ', '', 'words break no bones.ﬂ  To illustrate: if you come  ', '', 'in collision with a consummate villian, and you  ', '', 'say, ﬁI believe you to be a dishonest man: I can- ', '', 'not trust you,ﬂ the offence you give him is not  ', '', 'henious.

Now we deny, point-blank, that  ', '', 'all white men are averse to our enjoying political  ', '', 'privileges; and suppose we are in general, from  ', '', 'our peculiar position, intellectually inferior, is this  ', '', 'a good reason for the exercise of tyranny over us?

If a man, however ignorant in other  ', '', 'matters, shall by labor and economy possess him- ', '', 'self of this freehold, does this simple fact so enlight- ', '', 'en his understanding, as to render him more capable  ', '', 'of selectieg his rulers, than he was the day previous  ', '', 'to his becoming a freeholder?

The old adage is true, that ﬁsoft  ', '', 'words break no bones.ﬂ  To illustrate: if you come  ', '', 'in collision with a consummate villian, and you  ', '', 'say, ﬁI believe you to be a dishonest man: I can- ', '', 'not trust you,ﬂ the offence you give him is not  ', '', 'henious.

', '                 BY WILLIAM WHIPPER.] ', ' FELLOW MEMBERS', ':    Having been so highly honored by your suffrages, ', 'as to be elevated to the distinguished situation of ', '', 'presiding over this institution, the claims of duty re- ', 'quire of me the arduous task of explaining the mo- ', 'tives and considerations that should actuate us in ', '', 'promoting its objects. ', '', '   Those who associate themselves for the improve- ', '', 'ment of their moral condition, are exercising the ', '', 'highest order of legislation.  The present is an era ', '', 'for us to notice the evils, and mark the moral de- ', '', 'pravity, that have afflicted the human family since ', '', 'they have fallen from that holy estate that our first ', 'parents enjoyed. ', '   Intemperance', ', that blighting monster, that extir- ', 'pator of the human species, has slain mankind with ', '', 'a power that can only be likened unto the ', 'axe', ', which in the march of civilization is rapidly clearing ', '', 'our native forests.  It is an evil for magnitude unex- ', '', 'celled, and in the history of the world must stand ', '', 'without a parallel.  Even negro slavery, horrible as ', '', 'it is, painted in its most ignominious colors, and fer- ', 'reted out in all its degrading consequences, is but a  ', 'concomitant.  Probably to no people on earth would ', '', 'this language be more objectionable than to the ', '', 'present audience; yet I firmly believe it to be strict- ', '', 'ly true.  To a people like ours, whose whole history'], ['  is wrapt in the most obsequious degradation, multi- ', '', 'plied injuries and tyrannical barbarity, from the ef- ', '', 'fects of domestic slavery, they might be inclined to ', '', 'suppose that no human scourge had ever surpassed ', 'it in the enormity of its inflictions.  But a still great- ', 'er tyrant reigns.  It fills a more extensive rangeŠit ', '', 'occupies a higher seat; and swells its influence over ', '', 'the dominions of our world.  It is found in the pal- ', '', 'ace; it exists in the forum; it mingles with society; ', '', 'its abode is by the fireside; it is felt in the sanctuary; ', '', 'it despises the prejudices of caste; it seeks its vic- ', '', 'tims alike among the learned and ignorant, the poor ', '', 'and the rich; it confines itself neither to the geo- ', 'graphical lines of state or territory, of nation or con- ', 'tinent; but disdaining all local attachments, it claims ', '', 'for its domain the map of the universe. ', '', '   It is not my intention, o the present occasion, to ', '', 'delineate its features.  You all, probably, have seen ', '', 'the base original revelling in all its loathsomeness, ', '', 'defying alike the imagination of the poet, and the ', '', 'pencil of the artist, to describe its ghastly counte- ', '', 'nance and destructive mien.  The time may come ', 'when my limits may allow me to enter into the econ- ', 'omy of the subject; but for the present, I must only ', '', 'refer to the able speeches and writings of the tem- ', '', 'perance reformers, that are now so successfully rev- ', '', 'olutionizing public opinion on this important ques- ', '', 'tion.  I could quote from ecclesiastical history, and ', '', 'prove that the voluntary use of ‚ardent spirits™ is in- ', '', 'consistent with the spirit of the gospel and our holy ', '', 'religion.  I could refer to medical authority to prove ', 'its deleterious effect on the human system.  I claim ', 'not the high privilege of being a pioneer in this'], ['  cause.  But I hold it to be my duty to pass by all ', '', 'these, and approach the subject on new grounds; ', '', 'and I am proud to say that years have elapsed since ', '', 'I adopted the following sentiments, viz: ', '   That the people of color, in these United States, ', '(above any other class of citizens) are morally, po- ', '', 'litically and religiously bound to support the cuase ', '', 'of temperance, as advocated and supported in our ', '', 'country. ', '', '   We are indebted to the ingenuity of man for the ', '', 'two greatest evils that ever scourged the human ', '', 'family, viz. Intemperance and Slavery.  I mean by ', '', 'the former, that intemperance which has arisen from ', 'the use of ardent spirits.  By the latter, we are to ', 'consider that species of slavery, generally termed ', '', 'negro slavery.  I cannot probably better call your  ', '', 'attention to the subject, than by presenting for your ', '', 'consideration the comparative evils they inflict, and ', '', 'the forcible claims their very existence has upon the ', '', 'wise and good, for their total extirmination from the  ', '', 'face of the earth.  If I shall be able to convince ', '', 'those who hear me, that the former is as wicked and ', 'heinous as the latter, I feel confident that they will ', 'lend their influence to extirminate its roots from the ', '', 'soil of society. ', '', '   The principal effects of these evils on the charac- ', '', 'ter and interests of mankind you are familiar with. ', '', 'I need only present you with a few facts, asking ', '', 'leave to place them in the scales of Justice, regulat- ', '', 'ed by right and reason, and suffer you to form your ', '', 'own conclusions. ', '   We shall begin with negro slavery. ', '   What have been its effects on society and man-'], ['  kind generally? ', '', '   Why, it has made the master (though of human ', '', 'form, and bound by christian obligations to love ', '', 'and seek the welfare of himself and those around ', 'him) a tyrantŠa murderer of his speciesŠan earth- ', 'ly demon, pouring out his wrath on the innocent and ', '', 'unoffending, inflicting torments and stripes on the ', '', 'aged and infirm, separating husband and wife, pa- ', '', 'rents and their offspring, like cattle and beasts of ', '', 'burden; and to communicate the same wicked lesson ', '', 'to his children and survivors who visit on unborn gen- ', '', 'erations the same penalties; and society around him ', '', 'copies his example.  Although born in the image of ', 'his Maker, his life and acts bear the impress of Sa- ', 'tan.  He dies, and leaves his country taxed with na- ', '', 'tional crueltyŠhis heirs in the possession of God™s ', '', 'creatures, with their multiplied increase. ', '', '   Now, what are its effects on the slave?  Why, ', '', 'the dense fog of slaveholding cruelty, falling like ', '', 'mildew, smites the earliest dawn of his intellect, and ', '', 'destroys it in the bud.  His mind, that was formed ', '', 'to soar into infinite space, and there admire and ex- ', 'plore the beauties of creation, and the splendor of ', 'worlds,Šscarcely moves beyond the measure of his ', '', 'chains.  His body, unlike the animals of the forest, ', '', 'is without the natural covering to shelter his person ', '', 'from the pitiless storm; yet, like them, he seldom ', '', 'receives protection from the burning suns and chill- ', '', 'ing snows.  Though born and reared in the image ', '', 'of man, he walks to and fro with the taciturnity of ', '', 'the brute.  His mind not being permitted to [expand,] ', 'he remains destitute of that compound that God in- ', 'tended for his creatures, viz. a union of soul and'], ['  body; but in the stature of the latter he roams [over] ', '', 'the earth a walking animal. ', '', '   It is of materials like these, that the ligaments of ', '', 'society in slaveholding countries are formed.  [While] ', 'the oppressor deserves the condign punishment [of an] ', 'insulted Providence, and the just execration of the ', '', 'wise and good, the prayers of the righteous ought to ', '', 'ascend upwards, in torrents of supplication and ap- ', '', 'peal to Heaven for their deliverance.  Who will ', '', 'charge me with injustice in this description? ', '', '   But it now becomes our duty to describe the [', 'ty-', '] rant IntemperanceŠa ', 'demon', ' more ferocious [in his] ', 'character and despotic in the cruelty of his infliction, ', 'and the destructiveness of his sway.  All that I have  ', 'said, or that can be said against slavery, is truly ap- ', '', 'plicable to intemperance.  It is happy for mankind ', '', 'and the glory of humanity, that the wickedness [of] ', '', 'the former is confined to Africa and her descend- ', '', 'ants; while the latter, abhorring all national [distinc-] ', '', 'tions, spreads its ‚wide wasting calamity™ over the ', '', 'great family of nations.  It far surpasses the former ', '', 'in the cruelty of its depredations, the number of [its] ', 'victims, and its deathless ignominy.  If their [inflic-] ', 'tions were equal, the ratio of numbers alone would ', '', 'turn the scale.  But we shall exhibit some of its [de-] ', '', 'structive feats, that the former, with all its [atrocities,] ', '', 'is incapable of achieving.  The slave is only [kept] ', '', 'in subjection because his mind remains [stupified;] ', '', 'for both the security of the master and contentment ', '', 'of the slave forbid its expansion, because no large  ', '', 'number of intelligent beings can remain enslavedŠ ', 'for light and knowledge would dissolve the compact, ', 'melt the band, and burst the chains asunder.  The'], ['  tyrant Elrius makes no such limited pretensions [in] ', '', 'the perpetuity of his power; but, as if [determined] ', '', 'to keep mankind in awe, and subject the world to [his] ', '', 'control, he frequently reaches after the mightiest [in-] ', 'tellect, makes him bow his haughty head, bend his ', 'knee, fall down and worship the god Bacchas, and ', '', 'lay his trophies at his feet.  So that in the [posses-] ', '', 'sion of intelligence and learning, there is no safe [re-] ', '', 'treat from his grasp.  If the slave has wealth, he may ', '', 'purchase his freedom.  But to the subject of intem- ', '', 'perance, wealth only strengthens his chains; for [it] ', '', 'furnishes him with materials to revel in his guilt, and  ', '', 'fans the flame of his destruction.  The slave [has] ', 'his situation, and only remains in it because [his] ', 'bonds are forcible.  The other loves it, because [hav-] ', '', 'ing slain his reason and self-respect, it promotes [his] ', '', 'animal luxury. ', '', '   The slaveholder dreads rebellion and insurrection- ', '', 'ary movements; but the tyrant intemperance [fears] ', '', 'them not, for those whom he oppresses most, [love] ', '', 'him best.  He is an able ruler, alike skillful in the ', '', 'cabinet and the field: though a murderer and a des- ', 'pot, he reigns in the hearts of his subjects.  He is ', 'the prince of tacticians, heads a large army, and ', '', 'when he desires the acquisition of numbers to [pro-] ', '', 'cure new territory, he martials his soldiers, and ', '', 'stretches his magic wand, possessing in himself [the] ', '', 'power of the magnet.  Thousands follow after [him,] ', '', 'and join the train; few desert his camp; and [when] ', '', 'arrayed for combat, are seemingly invulnerable; but ', '', 'all fall in battle', '.    The slave may escape from the rule and [presence] ', 'of his master, by flying to a land of freedom; but'], ['    [Resolved, ', 'That the practice of non-resistance to ', 'physical aggression, is not only consistent with ', '', 'reason, but the surest method of obtaining a ', '', 'speedy triumph of the principles of universal ', '', 'peace.] ', '   Mr. President,ŠThe above resolution pre- ', 'supposes that if there were no God, to guide,  ', '', 'and govern, the destinies of man on this  ', '', 'planet, no Bible to light his path through the  ', '', 'wilds of sin, darkness and error, and no re- ', '', 'ligion to give him a glorious, and lasting  ', '', 'consolation, while traversing the gloomy  ', '', 'vale of despondency, and to light up his soul  ', '', 'anew, with fresh influence, from the fountain  ', 'of Divine grace,Šthat mankind might enjoy  ', 'an exalted state of civilization, peace, and  ', '', 'quietude, in their social, civil, and inter- ', '', 'national relations, far beyond that which  ', '', 'christians now enjoy, who profess to be  ', '', 'guided, guarded and protected by the great  ', '', 'Author of all good, and the doctrines of the  ', '', 'Prince of Peace. ', '', '   But, sir, while I am assuming the position,  ', 'that the cause of peace amongst mankind,  ', 'may be promoted without the scriptures, I  ', '', 'would not, for a single moment, sanction the  ', '', 'often made assertion, that the doctrines of  ', '', 'the holy scriptures justify warŠfor they are  ', '', 'in my humble opinion its greatest enemy.   ', '', 'And I further believe, that as soon as they  ', '', 'become fully understood, and practically  ', '', 'adopted, wars, and strifes will cease.  I be- ', 'lieve that every argument urged in favor of  ', 'what is termed a ﬁjust and necessary war,ﬂ'], ['  of physical self defence, is at enmity with  ', '', 'the letter, and spirit of the scriptures, and  ', '', 'when they emanate from its professed advo- ', '', 'cates should be repudiated, as inimical to the  ', 'principles they profess, and a reproach to  ', 'christianity itself.  I have said this much  ', '', 'in favor of the influence of the scriptures, on  ', '', 'the subject of peace.  It is neither my inten- ', '', 'tion, nor my province, under the present  ', '', 'resolution, to give proofs for my belief by  ', '', 'quotations from holy writ.  That portion of  ', '', 'the discussion, I shall leave to the minister  ', '', 'of the ', 'altar', ', and the learned and biblical  ', 'theologian.  Though I may make a few in- ', 'cidental quotations hereafter, I shall now  ', '', 'pass on for a few brief moments to the reso- ', '', 'lution under consideration, viz:   ', '', '   The resolution asserts, that the practice  ', '', 'of non-resistance to physical aggression is  ', '', 'consistent with reason.  A very distinguish- ', '', 'ed man asserts, ﬁthat reason is that distin- ', '', 'guishing characteristic that separates man  ', 'from the brute creation,ﬂ and that this power  ', 'was bestowed upon him by his Maker, that  ', '', 'he might be capable of subduing all subordi- ', '', 'nate intelligences to his will.ﬂ  It is this  ', '', 'power when exerted in its full force, that  ', '', 'enables him to conquer the animals of the  ', '', 'forest, and which makes him lord of crea- ', '', 'tion.  There is a right, and a wrong method  ', '', 'of reasoning.  The latter is governed by our  ', 'animal impulses, and wicked desires, without  ', 'regard to the end to be attained.  The former'], ['   fixes its premises, in great fundamental, and  ', '', 'unalterable truthsŠsurveys the magnitude of  ', '', 'the objects, and the difficulties to be sur- ', '', 'mounted, and calls to its aid the resources of  ', 'enlightened wisdom, as a landmark by which  ', 'to conduct its operations. ', '', '   It is self evident, that when the greatest  ', '', 'difficulties surround us, we should summon  ', '', 'our noblest powers.  ﬁMan is a being form- ', '', 'ed for action as well as contemplation;ﬂ  ', '', 'ﬁFor this purpose there are interwoven in  ', '', 'his constitution, powers, instincts, feelings,  ', '', 'and affections, which have a reference to his  ', 'improvement in virtue, and which excite him  ', 'to promote the happiness of others.ﬂ  When  ', '', 'we behold them by their noble sentiments,  ', '', 'exhibiting sublime virtues and performing  ', '', 'illustrious actions, we ascribe the same to the  ', '', 'goodness of their hearts, their great reasoning  ', '', 'powers and intellectual abilities.  For were  ', '', 'it not for these high human endowments,  ', '', 'we should never behold men in seasons of  ', 'calamity, displaying tranquility and forti- ', 'tude in the midst of difficulties and dangers,  ', '', 'enduring poverty and distress with a noble  ', '', 'heroism, suffering injuries and affronts with  ', '', 'patience and serenityŠstifling resentment  ', '', 'when they have it in their power to inflict  ', '', 'vengeanceŠdisplaying kindness and gene- ', '', 'rosity towards enemies and slanderersŠsub- ', '', 'mitting to pain and disgrace in order to pro- ', 'mote the prosperity of their friends and rela- ', 'tives, or the great interests of the human'], ['   race. ', '   Such acts may be considered by per- ', '', 'sons of influence and rank as the offspring  ', '', 'of pusillanimity, because they themselves  ', 'are either incapable of conceiving the purity  ', 'of the motives from which they emanate, or  ', '', 'are too deeply engulphed in the ruder pass- ', '', 'ions of our nature, to allow them to bestow  ', '', 'a just tribute to the efforts of enlightened  ', '', 'reason.    ', '', '   It is happy for us to contemplate, that  ', '', 'every age, both of the pagan and the chris- ', '', 'tian world, has been blessed, that they al- ', 'ways have fastened their attention on the  ', 'noblest gifts of our nature, and that they  ', '', 'now still shine as ornaments to the human  ', '', 'race, connecting the interests of one genera- ', '', 'tion with that of another.  Rollin, in speak ', '', 'ing of Aristides the Just, says ﬁthat an  ', '', 'extraordinary greatness of soul made him  ', '', 'superior to every passion.  Interest, pleasure,  ', '', 'ambition, resentment, and [justice were] ex- ', 'tinguished in him by the love of virtue and  ', 'his country,ﬂ and just in proportion as we  ', '', 'cultivate our intellectual faculties, we shall  ', '', 'strengthen our reasoning powers, and be pre- ', '', 'pared to become his imitators. ', '', '   Our country and the world have become  ', '', 'the munificent patron of many powerful, ex- ', '', 'isting evils, that have spread their devasta- ', '', 'ting influence over the best interests of the  ', 'human race.  One of which is the adopting  ', 'of the savage custom of wars, and fighting'], ['   as a redress for grievances, instead of some  ', '', 'means more consistent with reason and civi- ', '', 'lization.   ', '', '   The great law of love forbids our doing  ', 'aught against the interests of our fellow men.   ', 'It is altogether inconsistent with reason and  ', '', 'common sense, for person when they deem  ', '', 'themselves insulted, by the vulgar aspersions  ', '', 'of others, to maltreat their bodies for the acts  ', '', 'of their minds.  Yet how frequently do we  ', '', 'observe those that are blest by nature and  ', '', 'education, (and if they would but aspire to  ', '', 'acts that bear a parallel to their dignified  ', 'minds, they would shine as illustrious stars,  ', 'in the created throngs.) that degrade them- ', '', 'selves by practicing this barbarous custom,  ', '', 'suited only to tyrants Œ because in this they  ', '', 'may be justly ranked with the untutored  ', '', 'savages or the animals of the forest, that are  ', '', 'impelled only by instinct.   ', '', '   Another fatal error arises from the belief  ', '', 'that the only method of maintaining peace  ', 'is always to be ready for war.  The spirit of  ', 'war can never be destroyed by all the butche- ', '', 'ries and persecutions the human mind can  ', '', 'invent.  The history of all the ﬁbloody  ', '', 'tragedies,ﬂ by which the earth has been  ', '', 'drenched by human blood, cannot be justified  ', '', 'in the conclusion, for it is the spirit of con- ', '', 'quest that feeds itŠThomas Dick, after col- ', '', 'ecting the general statistics of those that  ', 'have perished by the all desolating pestilence  ', 'of war, says ﬁit will not be overrating the'], ['   destruction of human life, if we affirm, that  ', '', 'one tenth of the human race has been de- ', '', 'stroyed by the ravages of war,ﬂŠand if this  ', '', 'estimate be admitted, it will follow that more  ', 'than fourteen thousand millions of beings  ', 'have been slaughtered in war since the begin- ', '', 'ning of the world, which is about eighteen  ', '', 'times the number of its present inhabitants.   ', '', 'This calculation proceeds from a geographi- ', '', 'cal estimate, ﬁthat since the Mosaic creation  ', '', 'one hundred and forty-five thousand millions  ', '', 'of beings have existed.ﬂ   ', '', '   But, sir, it is not my intention to give a  ', 'dissertation on the subject of national wars,  ', 'although it appropriately belongs to my sub- ', '', 'ject.  I decline it only for the simple reason,  ', '', 'that it would be inapplicable to us as a peo- ', '', 'ple, while we may be more profitably em- ', '', 'ployed in inveighing against the same evil  ', '', 'as practiced by ourselves, although it exists  ', '', 'under another form, but equally obnoxious to  ', '', 'the principles of reason and christianity.   ', 'My reason for referring to national wars,  ', 'was to exhibit by plain demonstration, that  ', '', 'the war principle, which is the production  ', '', 'of human passions, has never been, nor can  ', '', 'ever be, conquered by its own elements.Š ', '', 'Hence, if we ever expect the word of proph- ', '', 'ecy to be fulfilledŠﬁwhen the swords shall  ', '', 'be turned into plough-shares, and the spears  ', '', 'into pruning-hooks, and that the nations of  ', 'the earth shall learn war no more,ﬂ we must'], ['                           ', 'EULOGY', '.    FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS', 'ŠTo duly awaken and  ', 'justly impress upon the feelings of an audience, the inestima- ', '', 'ble worth of an individual whose purity of life and upright- ', 'ness of character has imperishably enrolled his name in the  ', 'archives of nations, as one of the greatest earthly benefactors,  ', '', 'is a duty of such magnitude, that those who can call to their  ', 'aid the most powerful of human requisites might well in their ap- ', 'peal, ask for indulgence. In contemplating the history of man- ', '', 'kind in all ages, we are naturally led to the brow of a scenery  ', '', 'that presents so many varied hues, so intermixed and inter- ', 'woven with vice and virtue that, while there is much to ad- ', 'mire there is more to lament that the philosopher who could  ', '', 'only love causes for their effects, while he admired the hand  ', '', 'that adorned the picture, might frequently regret that mate- ', 'rials could have been found to produce the colouring.   ', '   The most pleasing history that can command our attention  ', '', 'is that which depicts the ancient splendour of Africa, when  ', '', 'the sunbeams of science and civilization were illumining that  ', 'vast continent, and imparting their benign influence to the  ', 'then dark and barbarous regions of the world. The most  ', '', 'horrible, that which exhibits her downfall, carrying with it  ', '', 'such heart-rendering consequences that human nature sickens  ', 'at the recital, and a Christian world might well exhibit her  ', 'lamentations in mourning and regret that she could point  ', '', 'either to the history of nations, or to that quarter of the globe  ', 'that would prove that ', 'she', ' had once existed. ', '   But the rise and fall of other nations has taught us that in- ', '', 'valuable example that an overruling Providence, in his wise  ', '', 'dispensation of affairs, has suffered governments as well as  ', 'individuals to perform their different revolutions. So that  ', 'when she who was the first to rise and demonstrate the value  ', '', 'of a regular cultivation of the arts, sciences, and civilization,  ', '', 'was the first to fall into degradation, barbarism, and super- ', 'stition, it was then only left her for to pourtray the folly of na- ', 'tional arrogance, and exhibit the destructibility of govern-'], ['  mental pride. But, my fellow citizens, we have not met to  ', 'commiserate the unfortunate condition of mankind, or to  ', 'lament the fate of governments. We have met to pay a tri- ', '', 'bute of respect to one of the best men that ever graced the  ', '', 'earth, or ornamented history. With talents of the highest  ', 'order, and whose labours have been the most indefatigable  ', 'in defence of human rights for upwards of forty years, both  ', '', 'in and out of Parliament, twenty years of which were spent  ', '', 'in appealing to and persuading Parliament to pass a law that  ', 'would change the slave trade from a national commerce to  ', 'a national piracy. To achieve this, he doubtless encountered  ', '', 'more difficulties, disappointments and persecutions than per- ', '', 'haps has fallen to the lot of any individual of his day, in the  ', 'prosecution of the most righteous enterprise. ', '   The eloquent and forcible appeals that he then made in be- ', '', 'half of poor unfortunate Africa, and her much injured sons  ', '(although the voice that spoke them into existence, like the  ', 'spirit that moved it, has quit this terrestrial ball,) have not  ', '', 'yet ceased to re-echo over the land, but fall on the ear  ', '', 'wherever forcibly uttered, with the same convincing power.   ', 'His speeches, though prepared for and directed towards the  ', 'members of Parliament, were destined to meet the views of  ', '', 'a more numerous and more enlightened assemblageŠI mean  ', '', 'posterity. His acts are now before the world to receive the  ', 'meed of praise to which they are so richly entitled. ', '   Doubtless no man ever lived who urged the passage of a  ', '', 'law with more honest zeal, or with such a torrent of  ', '', 'awakening eloquence as that which he used in beseeching  ', 'Parliament to quit her merciless invasions on poor, defence- ', 'less Africa. In one of his speeches, said to be the most pow- ', '', 'erful ever delivered in St. Stephens, he uses the following  ', '', 'language: ﬁWould you be acquainted with the character of  ', 'the slave trade, look to the continent of Africa, and there  ', 'you will behold such a scene of horrors, as no tongue can  ', '', 'express, no imagination represent to itself. One mode adopt-'], [' ed by the petty chieftains of that country is, that of commit- ', 'ting depredations upon each others™ territories. This cir- ', 'cumstance gives a peculiar character to the wars in Africa.   ', 'But this is not all. No means of procuring slaves is left  ', '', 'untouched. Even the ', 'administration of justice', ' itself is made  ', 'a fertile source of supply to this inhuman traffic. O, sir, these ', 'things are too bad to be longer endured; I cannot persuade ', 'myself that a British House of Commons will give its sanc- ', '', 'tion to the continuance of this inhuman traffic. Never was  ', '', 'there indeed a system so big with cruelty. To whatever  ', 'part of it you direct your view the eye finds no relief. Hurri- ', 'canes clear the air, and persecution promotes the propaga- ', '', 'tion of truth. But here it is otherwise. It is the prerogative  ', '', 'of this detested traffic to rob war of its generosity, and peace  ', 'of its security. You have the vices of polished society with- ', 'out its knowledge or its comforts, and the evils of barbarism  ', '', 'without its simplicity. No age, sex, or rank is exempt from  ', 'the influence of this wide wasting calamity.

', 'GENTLEMEN:  ', '   It is with the most pleasing sensations, and feelings of high gratifi- ', 'cation, that I, in behalf of my colored fellow citizens of New York, ten- ', 'der you of delegation to this convention a hearty welcome to our  ', '', 'city.  And in behalf of the conventional board, I repeat the welcome.   ', '', 'And, gentlemen, with regard to myself, my full heart vibrates the felici- ', 'tation. ', '   You have convened to take into consideration what may be the best  ', '', 'means for the promotion of the best interest of the people of color of  ', '', 'these United States, particularly of the free people thereof. ', '   And that such convention is highly necessary, I think a few consid- ', 'erations will amply show. ', '', '   First, the present form of society divides the interest of the communi- ', '', 'ty into several parts.  Of these, there is that of the white man, that of  ', 'the slave, and that of the free colored man.  How lamentable, how very  ', 'lamentable it is that there should be, any where on earth, a community  ', '', 'of castes, with separate interests!  That society must be the most happy,  ', 'where the good of one is the common good of the whole.  Civilization  ', 'is not perfect, nor has reason full sway, until the community shall see  ', '', 'that a wrong done to one is a wrong done to the whole; that the inte- ', '', 'rest of one is or ought to be the common interest of the whole.  Surely  ', 'that must be a happy state of society where the sympathies of all are to ', 'all alike. ', '', '   How pleasing, what a compliment to the nation, is the expression of  ', '', 'Mons. Vallier a celebrated traveler in Africa, where speaking of the Hot- ', 'tentots, he says ﬁThere none need to offer themselves as objects of com- ', 'passion, for all are compassionate.ﬂ  Whatever our early-tutored preju- ', '', 'dice may say to the contrary, such a people must be happy.  Give me  ', '', 'a residence in such a society, and I shall fancy myself in a community  ', 'the most refined. ', '   But alas for the people of color in this community! their interests is not  ', '', 'identified with that of other men.  From them, white men stand aloof.   ', 'For them the eye of pity hath scarcely a tear. ', '   To them the hand of kindness is palsied, to them the dregs of mercy  ', '', 'scarcely are given.  To them the finger of scorn is pointed; contumely'], ['  and reproach is continually theirs.  They are a taunt, a hissing, and a  ', '', 'by-word.  They must cringe, and crouch, and crawl, and succumb to their  ', '', 'peers.  Long, long, long has the demon of prejudice and persecution be- ', 'set their path.  And must they make no effort to throw off the evils by  ', 'which they are beset?  Ought they not to meet to spread out their wrongs  ', '', 'before one another?  Ought they not to meet to consult on the best means  ', '', 'of relief?  Ought they not to make one weak effort; nay, one strong, one  ', 'mighty moral effort, to roll off the burden that crushes them? ', '   Under present circumstances it is highly necessary the free people of  ', '', 'color should combine, and closely attend to their own particular interest.   ', '', 'All kinds of jealousy should be swept away from among them, and their  ', 'whole eye fixed, intently fixed on their own peculiar welfare.  And can  ', 'they do better than to meet thus; to take into consideration what are the  ', '', 'best means to promote their elevation, and after having decided, to pursue  ', 'those means with unabating zeal until their end is obtained? ', '   Another reason why this convention is necessary, is, that there is form- ', '', 'ed a strong combination against the people of color, by some who are  ', '', 'the master spirits of the day, by men whose influence is of the strongest  ', 'character, to whom this nation bow in humble submission, and submit to  ', 'their superior judgment, who turn public sentiment which ever way they  ', '', 'please. ', '', '   You cannot but perceive that I allude to the Colonization Society.  How- ', 'ever pure the motives of some of the members of that society may be, yet  ', 'the master spirits thereof are evil minded towards us.  They have put on  ', '', 'the garb of angels of light.  Fold back their covering, and you have in  ', '', 'full array those of darkness. ', '   I need not spread before you the proofs of their evil purposes.  Of  ', 'that you have had a quantity sufficient; and were there no other good  ', '', 'reason for this convention, the bare circumstance of the existence of such  ', '', 'an institution would be a sufficient one.  I do hope, confidently hope, that  ', 'the time will arrive, and is near at hand, when we shall be in full posses- ', 'sion of all the rights of men. ', '', '   But as long at least as the Colonization Society exists, will a convention  ', 'of colored people be highly necessary.  This society is the great Dagon  ', 'of the land, before whom the people bow and cry, Great Jehovah, and to'], ['  whom they would sacrifice the free people of color.  That society has  ', '', 'spread itself over this whole land, it is artful, it suits itself to all places.  ', '', 'It is one thing at the south, and another at the north; it blows hot and  ', 'cold; it sends forth bitter and sweet; it sometimes represents us as the  ', 'most corrupt, vicious, and abandoned of any class of men in the commu- ', '', 'nity.  Then again we are kind, meek, and gentle.  Here we are ignor- ', '', 'ant, idle, and nuisance, and a drawback on the resources of the country.   ', 'But as abandoned as we are, in Africa we shall civilize and christianize  ', 'all that heathen country. ', '', '   And by thus preaching continually, they have distilled into the minds  ', '', 'of the community a desire to see us removed. ', '   They have resorted to every artifice to effect their purposes. ', '   By exciting in the minds of the white community the fears of insur- ', '', 'rection and amalgamation; ', '   By petitioning state legislatures to grant us no favors; ', '   By petitioning congress to aid in sending us away; ', '', '   By using their influence to prevent the establishment of seminaries  ', '', 'for our instruction in the higher branches of education. ', '   And such are the men of that society that the community are blind to  ', 'their absurdities, contradictions, and paradoxes.  They are well acquaint- ', '', 'ed with the ground and the wiles by which to beguile the people. ', '', '   It is therefore highly necessary we should meet, in order that we may  ', 'confer on the best means to frustrate the purpose of so awful a foe. ', '   I would beg leave to recommend an attentive consideration to this  ', '', 'matter.  Already you have done much toward the enervation of this gi- ', '', 'ant: he begins to grow feeble; indeed he seems to be making his last  ', 'struggle, if we may judge from his recent movements.

Slavery, that Satanic monster, that beast whose mark has been  ', '', 'so long stamped on the forehead of the nations, shall be chained and cast  ', '', 'down into blackness and darkness forever. ', '   Soon, my brethren, shall the judgment be set.  Then shall rise in glory  ', 'and triumph, reason, virtue, kindness and liberty, and take a high exalt- ', '', 'ed stand among the sons of men.  Then shall tyranny, cruelty, prejudice  ', 'and slavery be cast down to the lowest depths of oblivion; yea, be ban- ', 'ished from the presence of God, and the glory of his power forever.  Oh  ', '', 'blessed consummation, and devoutly to be desired! ', '', '   It is for you, my brethren, to help on in this work of moral improve- ', 'ment.  Man is capable of high advances in his reasoning and moral  ', 'faculties.  Man is in the pursuit of happiness.

By managing this conference in a  ', '', 'spirit of good will and true politeness; by constantly keeping in view  ', '', 'and cultivating a spirit of peace, order and harmony, rather than satire,  ', 'wit, and eloquence; by putting the best possible construction on each  ', 'other™s language, rather than charging each other with improper motives.'], ['  These dispositions will bespeak our character more or less virtuous  ', '', 'and refined, and render our sitting more or less pleasant.

', 'While others rejoice in their deliverance from  ', 'a foreign yoke, they mourn that a yoke a thousand  ', '', 'fold more grievous, is fastened upon them.   ', '', 'Alas, they are slaves in the midst of freemen;  ', 'they are slaves to those, who boast that freedom  ', 'is the unalienable right of all; and the clanking  ', '', 'of their fetters, and the voice of their wrongs,'], [' make a horrid discord in the songs of freedom,  ', 'which resound through the land. ', '', '   No people in the world profess so high a res- ', '', 'pect for liberty and equality, as the people of the  ', 'U. States, and yet no people hold so many slaves,  ', 'or make such great distinctions between man  ', '', 'and man. ', '', '   From various causes, (among which we cheer- ', 'fully admit a sense of justice to have held no in- ', 'considerable rank,) the work of emancipation has  ', '', 'within a few years, been rapidly advancing in a  ', 'number of states.  The state we live in, since  ', 'the 4', 'th of July 1827, has been able to boast that  ', 'she has no slaves, and other states where there  ', '', 'still are slaves, appear disposed to follow her  ', 'example.   ', '   These things furnish us with cause of gratitude  ', '', 'to God; and encourage us to hope, that the time will  ', '', 'speedily arrive, when slavery will be universally  ', 'abolished.  Brethren, what a bright prospect  ', 'would there be before us in this land, had we no  ', '', 'prejudices to contend against, after being made  ', '', 'free. ', '   But alas! the freedom to which we have attain- ', 'ed, is defective.  Freedom and equality have  ', '', 'been ﬁput asunder.ﬂ  The rights of men are de- ', 'cided by the colour of their skin; and there is as  ', 'much difference made between the rights of a free  ', '', 'white man, and a free coloured man, as there is  ', '', 'between a free coloured man and a slave. ', '   Though delivered from the fetters of slavery,  ', 'we are opposed by an unreasonable, unrighteous,  ', '', 'and cruel prejudice, which aims at nothing less,  ', '', 'than the forcing away of all the free coloured'], [' people of the U. States, to the distant shores of  ', 'Africa.  Far be it from me to impeach the motives,  ', '', 'of every member of the African Colonization Soci- ', '', 'ety.  The civilizing and christianizing of that vast  ', 'continent, and the extirpation of the abominable  ', 'traffic in slaves, (which notwithstanding all the  ', '', 'laws passed for its suppression, is still carried on  ', '', 'in all its horrors,) are no doubt the principal mo- ', 'tives, which induce many to give it their support. ', '   But there are those, and those who are most  ', '', 'active and most influential in its cause, who hesi- ', 'tate not to say, that they wish to rid the country  ', 'of the free coloured population, and there is  ', '', 'sufficient reason to believe, that with many, this is  ', '', 'the principal motive for supporting that Society;  ', 'and that whether Africa is civilized or not, and  ', 'whether the slave trade be suppressed or not, they  ', '', 'would wish to see the free coloured people remo- ', '', 'ved from this country to Africa. ', '   Africa could certainly be brought into a state of  ', 'civil and religious improvement,  without sending  ', '', 'all the free people of colour in the United States  ', '', 'there. ', '   A few well-qualified missionaries, properly fit- ', 'ted out and supported, would do more for the in- ', '', 'struction and improvement of the natives of that  ', 'country, than a host of Colonists, the greater part  ', 'of whom would need to be instructed themselves,  ', '', 'and all of whom for a long period, would find  ', '', 'enough to do to provide for themselves, instead of  ', 'instructing the natives. ', '   How inconsistent are those who say, that Africa  ', '', 'will be benefitted by the removal of the free people  ', '', 'of colour of the United States there, while they'], [' say, they are the ', 'most vile and degraded', ' people  ', 'in the world. ', ' If we are as vile and degraded as  ', 'they represent us, and they wish the Africans to  ', 'be rendered a virtuous, enlightened and happy  ', '', 'people, they should not ', 'think', ' of sending ', 'us among  ', 'them, lest we should make them worse instead of  ', 'better.  ', '', '   The colonies planted by white men on the  ', '', 'shores of America, so far from benefitting the  ', 'aborigines, corrupted their morals, and caused  ', 'their ruin; and yet those who say ', 'we are the most  ', 'vile people in the world, would send us to Africa,  ', '', 'to improve the character and condition of the na- ', 'tives.  Such arguments would not be listened to  ', 'for a moment, were not the minds of the commu- ', '', 'nity strangely warped by prejudice. ', '', '   Those who wish that that vast continent should  ', 'be compensated', ', for the injuries done it, by send- ', 'ing thither the light of the gospel, and the arts of  ', '', 'civilized life, should aid in sending and supporting  ', 'well qualified missionaries, who should be wholly  ', 'devoted to the work of instruction, instead of   ', '', 'sending colonists, who would be apt to turn the  ', '', 'ignorance of the natives to their own advantage,  ', 'and do them more harm than good. ', '   Much has also been said by Colonizationists,  ', '', 'about improving the character and condition of  ', '', 'the people of colour of this country, by sending  ', 'them to Africa.  This is more inconsistent still.   ', 'We are to be improved by being sent far from  ', '', 'civilized society.  This is a novel mode of im- ', '', 'provement.  What is there in the burning sun,  ', 'the arid plains, and barbarous customs of Africa,  ', 'that is so peculiarly favourable to our improve-'], ['ment?  What hinders our improving here, where  ', 'schools and colleges abound, where the gospel is  ', 'preached at every corner, and where all the arts  ', '', 'and sciences are verging fast to perfection?  No- ', '', 'thing, nothing but prejudice.  It requires no large  ', 'expenditures, no hazardous enterprises to raise  ', 'the people of colour in the United States, to as  ', '', 'highly improved a state, as any class of the com- ', '', 'munity.  All that is necessary is, that those who  ', 'profess to be anxious for it, should lay aside their  ', 'prejudices, and act towards them as they do by  ', '', 'others. ', '   We are NATIVES of this country, we ask only to  ', 'be treated as well as FOREIGNERS.  Not a few of  ', '', 'our fathers suffered and bled to purchase its in- ', '', 'dependence; we ask only to be treated as well as  ', 'those who fought against it.  We have toiled to  ', 'cultivate it, and to raise it to its present prosper- ', '', 'ous condition, we ask only to share equal privi- ', '', 'leges with those, who come from distant lands,  ', 'to enjoy the fruits of our labour.  Let these  ', 'moderate requests be granted, and we need not go  ', '', 'to Africa nor any where else, to be improved and  ', '', 'happy.  We cannot but doubt the purity of the  ', 'motives of those persons who deny us these re- ', 'quests, and who send us to Africa, to gain what  ', '', 'they might give us at home.   ', '   But they say, the prejudices of the country  ', 'against us, are invincible; and as they cannot be  ', '', 'conquered, it is better that we should be removed  ', '', 'beyond their influence.  This plea should never  ', 'proceed from the lips of any man, who professes  ', 'to believe that a just God rules in the heavens. ', '', '   The African Colonization Society, is a numer-'], [' ous and influential body.  Would they lay aside  ', 'their ', 'own', ' prejudices, much of the burden would  ', 'be at once removed; and their example (especial- ', '', 'ly if they were as anxious to have ', 'justice done us  ', 'here', ', as to send us to Africa,) would have such an ', 'influence upon the community at large, as would  ', '', 'soon cause prejudice to hide its deformed head. ', '', '   But alas! the course which they have pursued,  ', 'has an opposite tendency.  By the ', 'scandalous mis- ', 'representations', ', which they are continually giv- ', 'ing of our character and conduct, we have sus- ', 'tained much injury, and have reason to apprehend  ', 'much more. ', '', '   Without any charge of crime, we have been  ', '', 'denied all access to places, to which we formerly  ', 'had the most free intercourse; the coloured citi- ', 'zens of other places, on leaving their homes, have  ', '', 'been denied the privilege of returning; and  ', '', 'others have been absolutely driven out. ', '   Has the Colonization Society had no effect in  ', 'producing these barbarous measures? ', '', '   They profess to have no other object in view,  ', '', 'than the colonizing of the free people of colour  ', 'on the coast of Africa, with their ', 'own consent;', ' but  ', 'if our homes are made so uncomfortable that we  ', '', 'cannot continue in them; or if like our brethren of  ', 'Ohio and New Orleans, we are driven from them,  ', 'and no other door is open to receive us but Afri- ', '', 'ca, our removal there will be any thing but volun- ', '', 'tary. ', '   It is very certain, that very few free people of  ', 'colour ', 'wish to go to that ', 'land', '.  The Colonization  ', 'Society ', 'know this, and yet they do certainly cal- ', 'culate, that in time they will have us all removed'], ['    That, as the success of this cause depends, un- ', 'der God, in a great measure upon the dissemination ', '', 'of our principles and plans of operation through ', '', 'the medium of the press, it is therefore the duty of ', '', 'our friends ', 'personally, ', 'to make ', 'immediate ', 'and  ', 'persevering ', 'efforts to secure the reading of at least ', 'one Anti', 'Slavery periodical in every family in the ', 'land.      He remarked as follows: This resolution brings ', 'before us a subject of duty which has not hereto', ' fore received that attention which its importance ', 'demands, viz. that of making PERSONAL efforts to ', '', 'spread LIGHT on this subject through the medium ', '', 'of the press. ', '', '   ﬁThe success of this cause depends in a great ', '', 'measure,ﬂ &c. Sir, it depends ', 'mainly ', 'upon the ', 'press.  Take away the aid, assistance and power ', 'of the ', 'press, ', 'and we might about as well fold up ', 'our hands.  The question is often asked, what has ', 'your press done? ', 'Done? ', 'Why sir, it has done al', ' most every thing which has been done in this  ', 'cause.  It has scattered anti-slavery papers all ', 'over the land', 'aroused the mind of this nation ', 'from a deathlike apathy, and set only this na', ' tion but the civilized world discussing the question ', 'of American slavery.', 'The press sir, has proba', ' bly made seven-eighths of all the abolitionists in ', 'this country. ', '', '   I will give a brief history of the publication ', 'department of the American Anti-Slavery Soci', ' ety.  At the anniversary of that Society held ', 'in New York in May, 1835, a resolution was passed ', '', 'to raise $30,000 to be expended in promoting the'], [' cause before the next annual meeting of the Soci', ' ety. ', '   On the strength of that resolution, the Execut', ' ive Committee greatly enlarged their plan of oper', ' ations.  They commenced an issue of fifty-thou', ' sand papers per week, and showered them down ', 'upon all parts of the United States.  They were ', '', 'not sent to slaves as was alleged by our enemies, ', '', 'but to Governors, Judges, Lawyers, members of ', 'Congress and of the State Legislatures, Clergy', ' men, Postmasters and Editors', 'men whose names ', 'are found in the public annals of the day.  If the ', 'slaves have got them, they have got them through ', '', 'the hands of their masters. ', '   The south began to think the fountains of abo', ' liton were broken loose, and were all coming down ', 'upon them at once.  Something must be done.', ' And what did they do, sir?  In the first place they ', 'broke open the post office at Charleston, S.C. ', 'seized two or three bags of our papers, and ', 'Lynch ed them.  ', 'Yes, sir, those papers suffered martyr', ' dom.  But ﬁthey being dead yet speak.ﬂ  They ', 'have spoken in tones of thunder, which have been ', '', 'heard the world over.  The pro-slavery journals ', '', 'of the South not only published this astounding ', '', 'fact to the world, but they advertised our papers ', 'published extracts from them, and in one or two in', ' stances copied whole columns of advertisements ', 'of Anti-Slavery, &c., and sent them throughout  ', '', 'the length and breadth of the slave States. ', '', 'The effect of this course was to set the public mind in ', '', 'commotion in the South, and awaken a curiosity'], [' in the minds of all who can read their ABC to see ', 'the incendiary prints.  Within one year from the  ', '', 'time of the Charleston outrage, ', 'fifteen thousand ', 'copies ', 'of the society™s publications were taken up ', 'by voluntary cash subscribers', 'a thing unheard ', 'of in the history of any other Moral Reform pub', ' lication ever started in this country.  For may ', 'of these subscribers we were, no doubt, greatly ', 'indebted to the gratuitous advertisements of the ', 'pro slavery press.  Our opposers took the wrong ', 'course to accomplish their object.  Instead of put', ' ting us ', 'down, they put us and our principles ', 'up  before the world', 'just where we wanted to be. ', '   The Society published regularly through the ', 'past year from 75 to 80,000 Nos. of these periodi', ' cal publications per month, most of which were ', 'distributed gratuitously by the friends of the cause ', 'in various parts of the United States.  The effects ', 'of this distribution upon those who read has been ', '', 'most favorable.  In vain do they look for seditious ', 'and incendiary doctrines, and they almost inva', ' riably express their astonishment that the South ', 'should bring such charges against them. ', '   This is the effect produced on Southern minds ', 'who candidly examine for themselves. ', '   Again', 'our papers alone have been the means ', 'of forming large and respectable Anti-Slavery  ', 'Societies.  Many facts like the following have ', '', 'come to our knowledge. ', '   A single No. of Human Rights', 'a leaf from ', 'the tree of liberty', 'found its way into a town ', 'where they knew nothing of the principles of abo'], [' lition.  One individual read it', 'liked it He cir', ' culated it among his neighbors', 'they liked it.   ', 'They ordered a quantity, and circulated them ', 'throughout the whole town.  Soon an Anti-Sla', ' very Society formed, embracing 40 males, ', 'besides females. ', '   Through the agents of this Society we shall ', '', 'probably receive a thousand dollars or more.  So ', '', 'much for one No. of Human Rights, which cost ', 'only 5 mills.  Again', 'the question is often asked, ', 'ﬁDo any of your publications go South.  Many  ', 'of them go there', 'some hundreds go there regu', ' larly by mail to subscribers and exchange papers. ', 'Two or three thousand of Miss Grimke™s appeal ', '', 'have recently been sent there, and but very few ', '', 'of them returned.  Many of our publications ', '', 'are purchased by Southerners at the office in New ', 'York.  Not long since a North Carolina slave', ' holder paid over sixty dollars for Anti-Slavery ', 'publications, which he distributed in the Slave ', 'States.  A few days since a President of a col', ' lege in a Slave State paid about nine dollars for ', 'a set of our books, pamphlets, &c.  Southern ', 'governors, members of Congress, and other gen', ' tlemen of standing and influence in the Slave ', 'States, often send for whole sets of Anti-Slavery ', 'books, pamphlets, tracts and prints.  They are ', 'anxious to see our publications and know what ', '', 'we are doing.  We are credibly informed, that most ', '', 'of our publications which have been destroyed ', '', 'in the slave States have been carefully persused. ', 'It is a fact that many of the publications preten'], [' ded to have been destroyed in Charleston were ', 'carefully preserved and read.  So the leaven of abolition ', '', 'is working at the South. ', '', '   Besides, Sir, multitudes of the South rush to the North ', '', 'every season, and many of them call at the Anti-Slavery ', 'offices in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Providence, and ', 'other places, and ask for our publications. Those who will ', 'not call for them, find more or less of them on [board] steam', ' [boats,] in public houses, and in hundreds of country and ', 'city parlors. ', '   [I do] see by these statements and facts, how we are [ope', ' rating] upon the South [through the medium of the press.] ', 'The cause advances', 'darkness, prejudice and [error recede,] ', 'just as fast as the true ', 'light ', 'blazes out from the ', 'press. ', '    Now, Sir, shall the press cease to thunder in the [ears of] ', 'the slaveholder his duty, and plead the cause of the [suffering] ', '', 'millions?  Shall it be crippled for want of the means?  Let ', '', 'every abolitionist answer for himself, by making personal ', '', 'efforts to sustain it[.] ', '', '   After what I have said, it requires no [argument] to [prove] ', 'ﬁthat it is the duty of Abolitionists ', '[personally] ', 'to make im', ' mediate and ', 'persevering ', 'efforts to secure the reading of at ', 'least one Anti-Slavery periodical in every [family in the] ', 'land.ﬂ  In this way, every one can do something ', 'effectu', ' ally ', 'to promote the good cause. ', '   The low price of our periodicals brings them within the ', 'reach of all.  Those who cannot afford to pay two [dollars] ', 'for the Emancipator, can pay one dollar for the [Quarterly] ', '', 'Magazine, or twenty-five cents for a copy of Human Rights. ', '', 'Five dollars will furnish forty-families with a copy of the ', 'Human rights a year.  Ten dollars will furnish one hun', ' dred families with the same.  Thirty dollars will [furnish]'], [' twenty families with a copy of the Emancipator weekly, ', 'provided they are ordered at one time, and all sent to [one] ', '', 'Post-office.  Five dollars will pay for six copies of the  ', '', 'Quarterly Magazine.  Here is a field into which every ', '', 'friend of the slave should enter.  A little [money expensed] ', 'in this way will do great good.  If every paper does [not] ', 'form an anti-slavery Society, it will probably make at least ', '', 'one convert to the cause, who would give his money and ', '', 'convert others. ', '', '   The executive committee have recently commissioned a ', '', 'large number of lectures, and their present means will ', '', 'not allow them to distribute their publications gratuitously [as] ', '', 'heretofore.  They have already curtailed their gratuitous ', 'distribution, and unless the friends of the cause come prompt', ' ly to their assistance and [furnish] the means, they will be ', 'obliged to curtail farther.  A much larger quantity has ', '', 'been circulated in this State gratuitously, in proportion to ', 'its size and population, than in any other state in the Un', ' ion.  Within fifteen months past, the Parent Society, have ', '[sent] more than one hundred thousand papers into this State ', '', 'at an expense of more than $1500.  Now, sir, we call ', '', 'upon the abolitionists of Rhode-Island to come forward ', '', 'and subscribe liberally to all our publications.  Let the [money] ', '', 'you giveŠyour personal efforts, and your prayersŠtell ', '', 'how much feel for two and a half millions of ', '', 'your brethren in bondage.'], ['                                          Mr. President ', ' I care not for  ', 'the prevalence of Colonization Societies; but I care for  ', 'the prevalence of their principles.  I hoped that these prin- ', '', 'ciples had been driven away by the sun of immediate  ', '', 'emancipation.  But I find they exist still, and efforts are  ', 'making to extend them throughout the land.  If there be  ', 'any thing that bodes evil to the colored people it is the  ', '', 'prevalence of these principles.  An effort is about to be  ', '', 'made in the principle places throughout the North to re- ', '', 'vive colonization.  And even, here, in the county of Onei- ', '', 'da, a call has just been circulated, inviting the friends of  ', '', 'colonization to meet in Utica, for the purpose of forming  ', '', 'a County Colonization Society.  I fear there has been a  ', '', '[selling] off our watchfulness, a coming down from the ', ' mountain top, a relaxing of our efforts, thinking that the  ', 'strife is nearly over.  O there are many persons in this  ', '', 'community who would not have been colonizationists, but  ', '', 'for closing their eyes against the truth!  They keep repudi- ', '', 'ating the principle of abolition, and they want something  ', '', 'to lull their consciences to sleep, so they embrace coloni- ', '', 'zation.   ', '', '   Colonization is the more dangerous as she comes to us in  ', '', 'the garb of Piety.  She comes with tears, wailing on ac- ', 'count of the benighted condition of Africa.  She appeals  ', 'to our benevolence and sympathy, and cries out, what  ', '', 'will become of Africa!  Poor, benighted Africa!  But her  ', '', 'principles are wrong; they foster prejudice and hatred a- ', '', 'gainst the colored race.  If the hand of tyranny were ta- ', '', 'ken from the slaves of the South, and the beams of Christ- ', '', 'ianity poured in their dark and benighted souls, would not  ', '', 'multitudes yearn to carry the gospel to Africa?  But [no- ', '', 'ting] as they are kept in chains and darkness their colored  ', 'brethren who are free feel bound to labor for their deliver-'], ['  ance.   ', '   Some have been led to look favorably upon this scheme  ', '', '[because] a great many good men have been engaged in it.   ', '', '[But] good men err; men are the same that they ever  ', '', '[were,] finite and fallible; and bad principles are very fre- ', '', 'quently found among good men.  So the good men that are  ', '', 'engaged in colonization cannot justify it.  Many men of  ', 'philanthropy and piety were led into it, honestly supposing  ', '[it] was the best thing for benefiting Africa, and they were  ', '', 'not aware, too, that the colored people opposed it.  They  ', '', '[erred] in not consulting those whom they wished to remove  ', '', 'to Africa.  Had they done this, many of them, I doubt not  ', '', 'would have scrutinized the principles of the society, and  ', '', '[seen] their criminality and sophistry.  Dr. Cox was a colo- ', '', 'nizationist until he crossed the Atlantic, and while here  ', '', 'he never knew that the colored people were opposed to  ', 'colonization.  The papers, the organs of the society, never  ', 'brought this subject in their columns ', ' never published the  ', 'resolutions of the various meetings of the colored people  ', 'throughout the free states.  Hence he could not know ex- ', '', 'cept by accident.  While in England his faith in coloniza- ', '', 'tion was shaken.  The anti-slavery atmosphere there was  ', 'too strong for him to be unaffected by it.  He there learned  ', 'that we were opposed to the society.  It was so new to him  ', '', 'that when he returned, he went to Samuel E. Cornish, now  ', '', 'editor of the Colored American, and asked him if it was  ', '', 'true that the colored people were opposed to the Coloniza- ', '', 'tion Society.  He then wrote a letter to the secretary of  ', '', 'the Colonization Society, requesting his name to be erased  ', '', 'from its list of members, and state, as one reason, that he  ', '', 'could not, conscientiously, belong to it, because the colored  ', 'people were opposed to it.  And many more, like Dr. Cox,'], ['  have forsaken it.   ', '', '   Notwithstanding colonization has been tested, and the  ', '', 'principles upon which it is founded shown to be unsound,  ', '', '[it] still exists.  It appears to the people under every variety,  ', '', '[and] form.  It changes its hues like the chamelion.  At the  ', '', '[ – ] its advocates say, ﬁwe don™t mean to trouble your in-  ', '', '[ – ]tions.  This society never contemplated emancipation.ﬂ   ', '[ – ] [the] North it is the only means to ultimately remove  ', '[ – ]ry.  But the Colonization Society is inadequate to the  ', '', '[ – ] it has undertaken.  It is impossible to colonize the  ', '', '[colored] people of America on the shore of Africa.  It can- ', '', '[not] be done.  You might as well think of draining the o- ', '', '[cean] with a tea-spoon.  The society increased to the high- ', '', '[est]ate of efficiency possible cannot remove the increase  ', '[alone].  O how absurd the idea, and foolish ', ' I might say  ', 'ﬁ[fanatical', ']ﬂ ', ' the attempt to remove 3,000,000 of human  ', '[beings] to the other side of the ocean.  We say to Christ- ', '[ians] beware how you make up your mind to join this cru- ', '', '[sade] against the colored people.  God looks at your con- ', '[science].  You will have to meet the colored man at the  ', '[Judge]ment!  Christ will say, as ye did it unto the least of  ', '', '[these] little ones, ye did unto me. ', '', '   [The] Colonization Society fastens and strengthens the  ', '', '[ prejudice] against colored people.  This prejudice falls like  ', '', '[a mountain] weight upon the poor colored man wherever he  ', '[goes] ', ' in thse tage, the steamboat, and railroad car ', ' in the  ', '[public] assembly, and even in the house of God.  It crush- ', '[es him] down to the dust and the grave!  It bars him from  ', '', '[equitable] and useful employment, and shuts him from the  ', '', '[temple] of science.  The colored man cannot even get a  ', '', '[license] to drive a carman™s cart in the city of New York.   ', '', '[This is] crushing and killing to the colored man!  I have'], ['  felt it myself.  And that prejudice is increasing among ma- ', 'ny who once were nearly free from it ', ' many pious men.   ', 'Why, if some of the ministers with whom I studied at  ', 'Princeton, with whom I prayed and worshipped, should  ', 'come up to me, and seize me by the hand, and say, ﬁbroth- ', 'er Wright, how do you do?ﬂ and take my arm, and walk  ', '', 'with me to his house, and seat me at me at his table, and  ', '', 'talk with me, why it would be ', 'ﬁamalgation!ﬂ ﬁamalga- ', 'tion!ﬂ  ', 'Yet this has been the case, before the increase  ', 'of prejudice had become so great.  These brethren do not  ', 'do it now ', ' it would be ', 'ﬁamalgamationﬂ', '  I can not exactly  ', 'see how colonizationists can raise the cry of amalgamation.   ', 'If a colored man goes round advocating ', 'colonization', ' he is  ', 'treated well, and is introduced on the platform at their  ', 'meetings ', ' there is no amalgamation here!  O amalgama- ', 'tion! amalgamation!  A colored brother who has fallen in- ', 'to the snare of colonization, and who lectures on that sub- ', 'ject, goes round among the whites, but does not go among  ', 'his colored brethren ', ' yet we do not hear of amalgama- ', 'tion!  I have conversed with this brother ', ' have prayed  ', 'and entreated him to abandon his scheme!  I told him  ', 'the colored people were opposed to it ', 'en masse', '  but  ', 'all without avail.  Yet while promoting his agency he  ', 'does not go among them!  If I were an anti-slavery a- ', '', 'gent and should pursue the same course, ﬁamalgamation!ﬂ  ', 'ﬁamalgamation!ﬂ would ring wherever I went. ', '   The colonizationists say to the colored people, ﬁyou can™t  ', '', 'rise here, among the whites.  This is not your home.  It  ', '', 'is Africa.ﬂ  Yes, it ', 'is Africa! sickly and barbarous Africa!   ', 'Where is our home if it be not the place where we were  ', '', 'born, brought up, and where we now reside?  Africa is ', 'not  our home; no more than England, Scotland, Germany and'], ['  Switzerland, are the homes of the Americans.  Why, a  ', '', 'gentleman a short time since said to me, do you suppose  ', '', 'the colored people can rise?  Why sir, said I, this is no  ', '', 'longer a problem to be solved.  It is worked out in the  ', '', 'West Indies and in Hayti.  It is proved there that a dark  ', '', 'skin does not prevent a man from rising in mental and  ', '', 'moral excellence.  He can there enjoy his rights.  The  ', 'prejudice that once galled him so, is fast wearing away.   ', 'Stations of usefulness and honor are now open to him.  O,  ', '', 'sir, when I am among colonizationists I do not feel myself  ', 'among friends ', ' I do not feel happy: but among abolition- ', 'ists I feel happy ', ' I feel that I am among my friends; and  ', 'the reason I appear among you and speak is, because I  ', 'know you are my friends!  Yes sir, here are my friends,  ', '', 'and I feel safe (tremendous cheering).  And I exhort you  ', '', 'to go on; and in a little while longer, with the blessings  ', '', 'of God, you will secure the objects for which you are la- ', 'boring ', ' the elevation of the colored man not only from  ', 'slavery, but from prejudice and hate!  Your opponents will  ', 'call you fanatics, but they know you are men.  The may  ', '', 'call you visionary and foolish, but they know you have  ', '', 'mind.

', '   Nothing is more common than the remark, that  ', 'anti-slavery agents are ﬁ men of one idea,ﬂ and  ', '', 'that their topics are very common-place.  It is true  ', '', 'with regard to the great subject involved in this re- ', '', 'solution, viz. prejudice against color, and the recog- ', '', 'nition of all the rights of the colored man, under  ', '', 'all circumstancesŠit is true that it is a trite and  ', '', 'common subject with three hundred thousand men  ', 'in this country.  They feel the evils of prejudice,  ', 'and the subject is emphatically common-place to  ', '', 'them.  The colored man, at every progressive step,  ', '', 'literally runs the gauntlet.  He is scarred from head  ', '', 'to foot, in all the walks of life.

This was shown by Mr. ', '', 'Yates, in his statements respecting their legal dis- ', '', 'abilities.  It was shown that they were deprived,  ', '', 'even in this state, of the right to trial by jury.  He  ', 'who address you might be arrested to-night, and,  ', 'brought before the magistrates of this city; and  ', '', 'if arrested as a slave, would not be allowed a trial  ', '', 'by jury. ', '', '   This prejudice also disfranchises a man of color, ', 'takes from him the right of choosing his rulers.', ' Had we time, we might dwell upon another class ', 'of disabilities thrown upon the man of color.  It ', '', 'imposes innumerable, and almost insurmountable ', '', 'obstacles to his obtaining a livelihood.  It deprives ', '', 'him of acquiring the mechanic arts.  The difficulty ', '', 'of colored young men in acquiring the knowledge of  ', '', 'trades, and after they have acquired the knowledge ', '', 'of trades of getting employment, is manifest.  It is ', '', 'well known that there is a monopoly here, so great ', 'a monopoly that men of color cannot enjoy these ', 'privileges, or if they do, with great difficulty.', ' From most of the usual occupations in society, ', 'they are excluded.  They are not employed as ', '', 'clerks, no matter what may be their talents or ', '', 'skill.  They are also deprived of the privileges of ', 'education.  Every person who is acquainted with ', 'the subject knows perfectly well, that throughout ', '', 'this whole state colored children are excluded from ', '', 'common schools.  In such places as Schenectady, ', '', 'Poughkeepsie, and Catskill, and all these large ', '', 'places, colored parents train up their children un- ', '', 'der great disadvantages, in respect to education. ', '', 'From colleges they have been entirely excluded,'], ['  with the exception of two or three', 'the Oneida In- ', 'stitute and Dartmouth College.  These two insti- ', 'tutions are now open.

But when he feels ', '', 'the pressure of such disabilities as I have mention- ', '', 'ed; when, whether at home or abroad, in the par- ', '', 'lor, the stage coach, the bar room, or the public ', 'mart, he feels the pressure of the chain, how can ', 'he be silent?  Why is all this?  Sir, it is to be ', '', 'traced to the spirit of slavery existing in the breasts ', '', 'of men, even in those who think they have sympa- ', '', 'thy for the oppressed.  This is the great support of ', '', 'the system of slavery.  Oh! there is enough in this ', '', 'feeling to cause tears of blood to flow from the eyes ', '', 'of those who possess it.  It is this that deprives ', '', 'man of his manhood; brings him down from that ', 'elevated position which God designed he should ', 'occupy, to a place with chattels and things.  Oh! ', '', 'if we had time to delineate the effects of this spirit, ', '', 'we should keep you here till midnight, stating facts ', '', 'and telling tales of woe, the thought of which makes ', '', 'our spirits sink within us.  I will state but a few  ', '', 'facts, illustrative of the effect of the prevalence of ', '', 'the cord of caste. ', '', '   Miss Betsy Stockton, a colored lady, who accom- ', 'panied Mrs. Stewart on the first mission, I think, to  ', 'the Sandwich Islands, was traveling for her health. ', '', 'In coming up the North River, although under the ', '', 'protection of a white gentleman, and although an'], ['  intelligent and philanthropic woman, who had cross- ', '', 'ed the ocean to aid in enlightening and converting ', '', 'the heathen, she was not permitted a place beneath ', '', 'the deck to lay her head in the damp night.  By ', 'this exposure her health was injured and her life ', 'endangered. ', '', '   Mrs. Smith was a pious woman, and lived in ', '', 'Newburgh.  She was going down the North River ', '', 'on the steam boat.  Night began to come on, and ', '', 'she thought of the infant she held in her arms. ', '', 'She went to the captain of the steam boat and plead ', '', 'for a place, where with her dear babe she might be ', '', 'comfortable, and its life and health not be jeopard- ', 'ed.  Such a place she was refused.  She arrived at ', 'the city of New-York.  Her child died, and after a  ', '', 'short period she died herself, from the cold she then ', '', 'caught. ', '', '   I might also mention the case of the Rev. Jere- ', '', 'miah Gloucester, former pastor of the Second Pres- ', '', 'byterian church in Philadelphia.  Eight years since ', '', 'he traveled, on his professional tour, through New ', 'England', 'was excluded from the cabin of a steam ', 'boat at night.  Although in poor health, like his ', 'master, he had not where to lay his head.  His ex- ', '', 'posure threw him into a decline, and he died. ', '', '   I might relate other painful facts, to illustrate the ', '', 'bearing of this prejudice upon the life of its victims. ', '', 'The following I state by request:  In the fall of ', '1828, a gentleman and a lady, friends of mine, with ', 'a little infant, came from Princeton, New Jersey, ', '', 'to visit me at Schenectady.  On the steam boat be- ', '', 'tween New-York and Albany, they were denied a'], ['  place to lay their heads at night.  When they ar- ', '', 'rived at Albany, they sought a passage in the stage ', '', 'for Schenectady.  The woman being light com- ', '', 'plexioned would pass for white.  She was interro- ', 'gated very promptly whether she wished a passage. ', 'She told them she did.  Her baggage was put on ', '', 'the stage.  But when she spoke to her husband, ', '', 'and they discovered he was a dark man, the bag- ', '', 'gage was taken off the stage, and they refused a  ', '', 'passage in it.  She sat down upon the baggage,  ', '', 'with her babe in her arms, and wept, when some ', '', 'benevolent friend, seeing their condition, kindly pro- ', '', 'cured for them a private vehicle, at an expense of ', 'four dollars, which conveyed them to my residence ', 'in Schenectady.  On their return from their visit, ', '', 'they went to Albany, expecting to meet the steam ', '', 'boat Albany, which, at that time, was very favor- ', '', 'ably disposed toward the people of color.  But, ', '', 'unfortunately, they were a few moments too late. ', '', 'Their condition then was lamentable.  I went from ', '', 'steam boat to steam boat; made great efforts to pro- ', '', 'cure a passage for them, so that the mother, with ', 'her infant, might return comfortably; but in vain ', 'was my attempt.  Whilst her husband left her and  ', '', 'went home, I was compelled to return with her to ', '', 'my residence in Schenectady.  When the boat re- ', '', 'turned to Albany, with my companion, I accompa- ', '', 'nied her home to Princeton.  On our return, be- ', '', 'tween Brunswick and New-York, we were over ', '', 'taken by a tremendous gale and rain; and in con- ', '', 'sequence of my companion being excluded from ', 'the ladies™ apartment, she caught a violent cold, ', 'which detained us several days in New-York.'], ['  Now despair almost drank up my spirits.  I went ', '', 'from steam boat to steam boat, from line to line, to ', '', 'obtain a place, even below the deck, so that our ', '', 'lives might not be endangered.  I made interest ', 'with my friends to strive for me, but in vain.  At ', 'length we went on board of the steam boat, and ', '', 'were compelled to sit on deck.  This was in the  ', '', 'fall; ice was in the river, and the weather was ', '', 'cold.  At night, my wife was permitted to sleep  ', '', 'with the cook, in a dirty apartment near the ma- ', 'chinery, whilst I was permitted', 'and thankful was ', 'I for the privilege', 'to lie down on the deck, inclos- ', 'ed as it is from the weather.  In the morning, we ', 'rejoiced and blessed God together for the preserva- ', '', 'tion of our lives.  But alas! my wife had received ', '', 'the fatal shaft, and she died after a few months, in ', 'consequence of the cold she then caught.  Here ', 'are the results of prejudice; and such things are ', '', 'constantly taking place.  Now I call upon all pre- ', '', 'sent to ask themselves, if ', 'here', ' they ought not to  ', 'remember those who are in bonds as bound with ', '', 'them.  How would the men and women of this ', '', 'convention feel and act, were they similarly cir- ', '', 'cumstanced?  How would the members of this ', '', 'meeting act, were they under the disabilities of the ', 'colored man? ', '   As I said before, we have to run the gauntlet. ', '', 'Sabbath before last, I had occasion to visit New ', '', 'Rochelle, to see my family, who were then in that ', '', 'place.  I attended the Presbyterian church in the ', 'morning', 'took a place in the gallery.  I was re- ', 'quested to leave my seat, and occupy another place. ', 'I did not think it proper, however, to move, and'], ['    ﬁSo far as can be gathered, the first systematic efforts  ', 'made in this city, for the education of the people of color,  ', '', 'was commenced about the year 1805.  A school was then  ', '', 'established for their benefit under the patronage of the facul- ', '', 'ty of Union College, more especially of the President.  For  ', '', 'a season, it was well attended and promised much, but for  ', '', 'reasons unknown to us, was discontinued, after the lapse of  ', '', 'two years. ', '   ﬁThen followed a season of utter destitution of the means  ', 'of education.  In vain did our parents plead for the admis- ', '', 'sion of their children, to privileges of other schools.  They  ', '', 'wept and besought Œ but their tears and entreaties were una- ', '', 'vailing. ', '   ﬁThe next effort on our behalf, was put forth by the fol- ', 'lowers of Wesley.  In all the sincerity and godly simplicity  ', 'of the gospel, our Methodist friends not only contemplated  ', 'our moral destitution, but were actuated by a noble zeal, to  ', 'alleviate our sorrows and to enlighten the ignorant, by visit- ', 'ing from house to house.  More than this, they threw open  ', 'the doors of schools established for the benefit of their own  ', 'children, taught successfully by good Mr. Whiting, Bliss,  ', 'and a worthy lady by the name of Sally Eldridge, with whose  ', 'names are associated many pleasing reflections, and who are  ', 'now, doubtless, enjoying their eternal rest.  They did not  ', '', 'lacerate our young and tender minds, by those cruel and un- ', 'reasonable proscriptions which, alas™ too often repress the  ', 'ardor of the colored youth, and drive him with disgust from  ', 'the halls of learning. ', '   ﬁBy the adoption of [different] means, we were at length  ', 'deprived of these advantages.  Then followed another famine  ', 'of food for the mind.  For several years, those parents who  ', '', 'were awake to the value of education, were compelled to'], ['  avail themselves of the only alternative Œ that of private in- ', '', 'structions.  Not unfrequently, did they gather together their  ', '', 'little ones of the dawn of day, to prepare them for recita- ', '', 'tions.  ', 'Thus were we taught.  ', 'Under these disabilities did  ', 'we learn our first lessons.', '    ﬁBut hitherto hath the Lord helped.  He hath done great  ', '', 'things, whereof we are glad.  Upon this auspicious day Œ on  ', 'this heart gladdening occasion Œ before this newly erected al- ', 'tar will we erect our Ebenezer, and upon it gratefully in- ', '', 'scribe,  ', 'HITHERTO HATH THE LORD HELPED.ﬂ'], ['    Mr. President,Šall who have heard the  ', 'report which has been presented, are satis- ', '', 'fied it needs no eulogy.  It supports itself.   ', '', 'But, sir, I would deem it a privilege to  ', '', 'throw out a few thoughts upon itŠthoughts  ', '', 'which arise on beholding this audience.  My  ', '', 'mind is involuntarily led back a few years  ', '', 'to the period prior to the commencement of  ', 'this great moral effort for the removal of the  ', 'giant sin of oppression from our land.  It is  ', '', 'well known to every individual who is at all  ', '', 'acquainted with the history of slavery in this  ', '', 'land, that the convention of 1776, when the  ', '', 'foundations of our government were laid,  ', '', 'proclaimed to the world the inalienable  ', '', 'rights of man; and they supposed that the  ', '', 'great principles of liberty would work the  ', 'destruction of slavery throughout this land.   ', 'This remark is sustained by an examination  ', '', 'of the document then framed, and by the fact  ', '', 'that the term ﬁslaveryﬂ is not even named.   ', '', 'The opinion that slavery would be abolish- ', '', 'edŠindeed, that it had already received a  ', '', 'death-blow, was cherished by all the reform- ', '', 'ers.  This spirit actuated Woolman, Penn,  ', '', 'Edwards, Jefferson, and Benezet, and it  ', 'worked out the entire emancipation of the  ', 'north.    But it is well known that about  ', '', '1817, a different drift was givenŠa new  ', '', 'channel was opened for the benevolence  ', '', 'which was working so well.  The principle  ', '', 'of expatriation, like a great sponge, went  ', '', 'round in church and state, among men of all'], [' classes, and sponged up all the benevolent  ', 'feelings which were then prevalent, and  ', '', 'which promised so much for the emancipa- ', '', 'tion of the enslaved and down-trodden mil- ', '', 'lions of our land.  That, sir, we call the  ', '', 'dark period.  Oh, sir! if my father who sits  ', '', 'beside me were to rise up and tell you how  ', '', 'he felt, and how men of his age felt, and how  ', 'I felt, (though a boy at that time,) sir, it  ', 'would be seen to have been a dark period.  ', '', ' Why, sir, the heavens gathered blackness,  ', '', 'and there was nothing cheering in our pros- ', '', 'pects.  A spirit was abroad, which said ‚this  ', '', 'is not your country and home,™ a spirit which  ', '', 'would take us away from our fire-sides, tear  ', '', 'the freeman away from his oppressed broth- ', '', 'er.  This spirit was tearing the free father  ', 'away from his children, separating husband  ', 'and wife, sundering those cords of consan- ', '', 'guinity which bind the free with the slave.    ', '', 'This scheme was as popular as it possibly  ', '', 'could be.  The slaveholder and the pro-sla- ', '', 'very man, the man of expanded views, the  ', '', 'man who loved the poor and oppressed of ev- ', '', 'ery hue and of every clime, all united in this  ', '', 'feeling and principle of expatriation.  But,  ', 'sir, there were hundreds of thousands of men  ', 'in the land, who never could sympathize in  ', '', 'this feeling; I mean those who were to be  ', '', 'removed.  The people of color were broken- ', '', 'hearted; they knew, sir, there were physical  ', '', 'impossibilities to their removal.  They knew  ', '', 'sir, that nature, reason, justice and inclina-'], ['  tion forbade the idea of their removing; and  ', '', 'hence in 1817, the people of color in Phila- ', '', 'delphia, with James Forten at their head,Š ', '', '(and I envy them the honor they had in the  ', '', 'work in which they were engaged,) in an as- ', '', 'sembly of three thousand, before high hea- ', '', 'ven, in the presence of Almighty God, and  ', 'in the midst of a persecuting nation, resolv- ', 'ed that they never would leave the land.Š ', '', 'They resolved to cling to their oppressed  ', '', 'brethren.  They felt that every ennobling spir- ', '', 'it forbade their leaving them.  They resolv- ', '', 'ed to remain here, come what would, perse- ', '', 'cution or death.  They determined to grap- ', '', 'ple themselves to their enslaved brethren as  ', '', 'with hooks of steel.  My father, at Schenec- ', 'tady, under great anxiety, took a journey to  ', 'Philadelphia, to investigate the subject.Š ', '', 'This was the spirit to which prevailed among  ', '', 'the people of color, and it extended to every  ', '', 'considerable place in the north, and as far  ', '', 'south as Washington and Baltimore.  They  ', '', 'lifted up their voice and said, this is my  ', '', 'country, here I was born, here I have toiled  ', '', 'and suffered, and here will I die.  Sir, it  ', 'was a dark period.  Although they were  ', 'unanimous, and expressed their opinions,  ', '', 'they could not gain access to the public  ', '', 'mind; for the press would not communicate  ', '', 'the facts in the caseŠit was silent.  In the  ', '', 'city of New-York, after a large meeting,  ', '', 'where protests were drawn up against the'], [' system of colonization, there was not a sin- ', 'gle public journal in the city, secular or re- ', '', 'ligious, which would publish the views of  ', '', 'the people of color, on the subject.   ', '', '   Sir, despair brooded over our minds.  It  ', '', 'seemed as though every thing was against  ', '', 'us.  We saw philanthropists, for instance  ', '', 'such men as Rev. Dr. Cox, swept away by  ', 'the waves of expatriation.  Other men, such  ', 'as our president before us, who were engag- ', '', 'ed in schemes of benevolence in behalf of the  ', '', 'people here, abandoning those schemes.  It  ', '', 'was a general opinion that it would do no  ', '', 'good to elevate the people of color here.Š ', '', 'Our hearts broke.  We saw that coloniza- ', '', 'tion never could be carried out; for the an- ', '', 'nual increase of the people of color was 70,- ', '00. We used to meet together and talk  ', 'and weep and what to do we knew not.  We  ', '', 'saw indications that coercive measures  ', '', 'would be resorted to.  Immediately after  ', '', 'the insurrection in Virginia, under Nat Tur- ', '', 'ner, we saw colonization spreading all over  ', '', 'the land; and it was popular to say that peo- ', '', 'ple of color must be removed.  The press  ', '', 'came out against us, and we trembled.Š ', 'Maryland passed laws to force out the color- ', 'ed people.  It was deemed proper to make  ', '', 'them go, whether they would or not.  Then  ', '', 'we despaired.  Ah, Mr. President, that was  ', '', 'a dark and gloomy period.  The united  ', '', 'views and intentions of the people of color  ', '', 'were made known, and the nation awoke'], [' as from slumber.  The ‚Freedom™s Journal,™  ', 'edited by Rev. Samuel E. Cornish, announ- ', '', 'ced the facts in the case, our entire opposi- ', '', 'tion.  Sir, it came like a clap of thunder!   ', '', 'I recollect at Princeton, where I was then  ', '', 'studying, Dr. Miller came out with his let- ', '', 'ter, disapproving of the editor™s views, and  ', '', 'all the faculty and the students gave up the  ', 'paper.  Benj. Lundy of Baltimore nobly  ', 'lifted up his voice.  But he did not feel the  ', '', 'vileness of colonization.  A young man, for  ', '', 'making certain expositions touching slave- ', '', 'ry, was incarcerated in a dungeon, where  ', '', 'truth took a lodgement in his heart, where  ', '', 'he avowed eternal hatred to slavery, and  ', '', 'where, before high heaven, in the secrecy of  ', '', 'his dungeon, with the chains upon him, he  ', 'resolved to devote his life to the cause of  ', 'emancipation.    *     *    And when the  ', '', 'president of the American Anti-Slavery So- ', '', 'ciety stepped forward and paid the fine, we  ', '', 'were crying for help Œ we were remonstra- ', '', 'ting.  We had no other means but to stand  ', '', 'up as men, and protest.  We declared, this  ', '', 'is our country and our home; here are the  ', '', 'graves of our fathers.  But none came to  ', 'the rescue.   ', '   At that dark moment we heard a voice;  ', '', 'it was the voice of Garrison, speaking in  ', '', 'trumpet tones!  It was like the voice of an  ', '', 'angel of mercy!  Hope, hope then cheered  ', '', 'our path.  The signs of the times began to  ', '', 'indicate brighter days.  He thundered, and'], [' next we hear of a Jocelyn of New-Haven, an  ', 'Arthur Tappan at his side, pleading for the  ', '', 'rights of the colored American.  He stood  ', '', 'up in New-Haven amid commotion and per- ', '', 'secution, like a rock amid the dashing  ', '', 'waves.  Ought I not this afternoon to call  ', '', 'upon my soul, and may I not ask you to  ', '', 'call upon ', 'your souls', ' to bless the Lord for  ', 'His unspeakable goodness in bringing about  ', 'the present state of things?

Sir, I am identified with ', '', 'two millions and a half of men, women, and ', '', 'children, whose minds, as well as their bodies, ', '', 'are chained down and crushed by slavery, and ', '', 'who have no power to speak for themselves.

You ', '', 'have gone forth armed with prayer, in the spirit ', '', 'of the Prince of Peace.  The whole land has ', '', 'been raised up against you, because you have la- ', '', 'bored to convince the oppressor, that he should no ', 'longer oppress.

Prophets have a- ', '', 'risen among them, who hold forth to the people, the  ', '', 'continuation of our political thraldom, unless there  ', '', 'be a general removal of all the free among us to the  ', 'coast of Africa.  Others argue, that, although they'], [' have good feelings towards us, and would do any  ', 'thing for us, if we were out of their sight and out of  ', '', 'hearing of their slaves, yet to admit us into their  ', '', 'circles would be to pervert the present order of so- ', '', 'ciety, and the happiness of the good white citizens  ', '', 'of the country.  These are generally bible men, such  ', '', 'as hold forth the true oracles of God; yet deny him,  ', '', 'in their actions and words, the supreme control over  ', 'all his creatures.  There is hardly ever an action per- ', 'formed, whether good or bad, but there is generally  ', '', 'a reason given for so doing; and he is a wicked,  ', '', 'daring character, who cannot find a cloak, at any  ', '', 'time, to cover his hideous crimes.  The men who have  ', '', 'been foremost, in withholding from us our dearest  ', '', 'and most sacred rights, have always held out false  ', '', 'colors to the community at large, (such as, inferi- ', '', 'ority, degradation, nuisance, pest, slaves, species of  ', 'monkey, apes, &c.) to justify their inhuman and  ', 'unchristian acts towards us, and to deaden the severe  ', '', 'pangs of conscience that harass them.  They would  ', '', 'wish to appear innocent before the world; as doing  ', '', 'unto all men as they would they should do unto them.

', '', '   The present situation of our free colored people  ', '', 'has awakened general concern, and aroused general  ', '', 'sympathy in the community, so as to call for their  ', '', 'charities to be appropriated, not to the advancement  ', '', 'of civilization, education, arts and sciences, and the  ', '', 'elevation of our moral, civil and political character  ', '', 'in this country; but, on the contrary, to send us to  ', 'an unknown land, that we can no more justly claim  ', 'than the whites of this country can the continent of  ', '', 'Europe, where we shall be forced to sever the bonds  ', '', 'of affection with our slave brethren, and leave all  ', 'that is near and dear to us, ', ' the ties of country, and  ', 'the graves of our fathers.  Can such charities pro- ', 'ceed from a christian source?  I am persuaded, they  ', 'are based upon prejudice, pride, ambition, jealousy,  ', '', 'hatred, malice, and impure heart; from whence every  ', '', 'other black art has its origin.  And why?  Because  ', '', 'our color and features do not exactly resemble theirs.   ', '', 'If their sympathies proceed from christian principles,  ', '', 'why not adopt the measures taken by patriarch  ', '', 'Abraham and his nephew Lot, as there is plenty of  ', '', 'land on the right hand and on the left, to satisfy the  ', 'calls of humanity?

The reasons are obvious.

', '', '   The profits arising from the sweat and blood of  ', '', 'our brethren, together with the existing ignorance a- ', 'mong us, is the cause of much interest and specula- ', 'tion among our enemies, both in the slaveholding  ', '', 'and non-slaveholding States.  So far as we become  ', '', 'civilized and educated, so far their interest, in the  ', '', 'bones and muscles of our brethren, is at stake[.]   ', '', 'Hence the object of colonizing us on the shores of  ', '', 'Africa; whom they represent as a pest, a nuisance;  ', '', 'and who are likely to lead the slaves to insubordina- ', '', 'tion.  Many have bitterly denied these assertions;  ', 'but as a specimen of their good feelings towards us,  ', 'we will refer, for our satisfaction, to some of the  ', '', 'late resolutions of Virginia, North Carolina, South  ', '', 'Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana; more particularly,  ', '', 'the ordinances of Charleston, Savannah, and New- ', '', 'Orleans; where we, as free people, are not allowed  ', '', 'to set foot upon their shores, except under certain re- ', '', 'strictions; and in some of those places the masters'], ['  of vessels are subject to a heavy fine, for bringing  ', '', 'any of us into their ports; and the persons brought  ', '', 'are imprisoned, and their backs lacerated with a cow- ', '', 'skin, cart-whip, or whatever unholy weapon the  ', '', 'deluded hearts of slaveholders may direct them to.   ', '', 'Many of those wretches are colonization men, who  ', '', 'wish to send us across the Atlantic ocean, with the  ', 'pleasing phantom of elevating us to rank, riches,  ', 'wreaths and laurels.

The men who have  ', '', 'been foremost, in withholding from us our dearest  ', '', 'and most sacred rights, have always held out false  ', '', 'colors to the community at large, (such as, inferi- ', '', 'ority, degradation, nuisance, pest, slaves, species of  ', 'monkey, apes, &c.) to justify their inhuman and  ', 'unchristian acts towards us, and to deaden the severe  ', '', 'pangs of conscience that harass them.  They would  ', '', 'wish to appear innocent before the world; as doing  ', '', 'unto all men as they would they should do unto them.   ', '', 'Do they base their objects, in full, upon such frivo- ', '', 'lous excuses as these?  No.  The truth is, actions  ', '', 'speak louder than words.  It is my candid opinion,  ', '', 'there would have been no Colonization Society  ', 'formed for our transportation to the western coast of  ', 'Africa, had there been no free colored people, and  ', '', 'did not our numbers increase daily.  If we, as a free  ', '', 'body of people, had remained in the same character  ', '', 'with slaves, monkeys and baboons, there would not  ', '', 'have been so much excitement in the community a- ', '', 'bout us; but as they see, by our improvement, (a'], [' great improvement, indeed, within forty years,) that  ', 'the period is hastening on, when there will be no  ', '', 'other alternative but we must rank among them in  ', '', 'civilization, science and politics, they have got up  ', '', 'this colonization scheme to persuade us to leave our  ', '', 'slave brethren, and flee to the pestilential shores of  ', '', 'Africa, where we shall be in danger of being forced  ', '', 'to hang our harps upon the willows, and our song of  ', 'liberty and civilization will be hushed by the impell- ', 'ing force of barbarian despots. ', '', '   The present situation of our free colored people  ', '', 'has awakened general concern, and aroused general  ', '', 'sympathy in the community, so as to call for their  ', '', 'charities to be appropriated, not to the advancement  ', '', 'of civilization, education, arts and sciences, and the  ', '', 'elevation of our moral, civil and political character  ', '', 'in this country; but, on the contrary, to send us to  ', 'an unknown land, that we can no more justly claim  ', 'than the whites of this country can the continent of  ', '', 'Europe, where we shall be forced to sever the bonds  ', '', 'of affection with our slave brethren, and leave all  ', 'that is near and dear to us, ', ' the ties of country, and  ', 'the graves of our fathers.  Can such charities pro- ', 'ceed from a christian source?  I am persuaded, they  ', 'are based upon prejudice, pride, ambition, jealousy,  ', '', 'hatred, malice, and impure heart; from whence every  ', '', 'other black art has its origin.  And why?  Because  ', '', 'our color and features do not exactly resemble theirs.   ', '', 'If their sympathies proceed from christian principles,  ', '', 'why not adopt the measures taken by patriarch  ', '', 'Abraham and his nephew Lot, as there is plenty of  ', '', 'land on the right hand and on the left, to satisfy the  ', 'calls of humanity?  If that would not answer, why'], ['  not purchase the Texas, or some other neighboring  ', '', 'province, and cede it to us, as a pledge of their faith  ', '', 'towards us, whom they have so long injured; and  ', '', 'break the bonds of slavery asunder at the south, that  ', '', 'two millions of us may, like ancient Israel, march  ', '', 'forward with our flocks, our herds, our wives, and  ', '', 'our little ones, to a country where we shall not be  ', 'so much exposed to the seas and the pestilential va- ', 'pors of the torrid zone?  The reasons are obvious.   ', '', 'Their hearts are hardened against us, like haughty  ', '', 'Pharaoh™s, who would not let Israel go, until visited  ', '', 'by severe plagues and the judgements of an angry  ', '', 'God, who cannot endure and will not uphold injus- ', '', 'tice exercised upon one of his creatures. ', '', '   The profits arising from the sweat and blood of  ', '', 'our brethren, together with the existing ignorance a- ', 'mong us, is the cause of much interest and specula- ', 'tion among our enemies, both in the slaveholding  ', '', 'and non-slaveholding States.  So far as we become  ', '', 'civilized and educated, so far their interest, in the  ', '', 'bones and muscles of our brethren, is at stake[.]   ', '', 'Hence the object of colonizing us on the shores of  ', '', 'Africa; whom they represent as a pest, a nuisance;  ', '', 'and who are likely to lead the slaves to insubordina- ', '', 'tion.  Many have bitterly denied these assertions;  ', 'but as a specimen of their good feelings towards us,  ', 'we will refer, for our satisfaction, to some of the  ', '', 'late resolutions of Virginia, North Carolina, South  ', '', 'Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana; more particularly,  ', '', 'the ordinances of Charleston, Savannah, and New- ', '', 'Orleans; where we, as free people, are not allowed  ', '', 'to set foot upon their shores, except under certain re- ', '', 'strictions; and in some of those places the masters'], ['  of vessels are subject to a heavy fine, for bringing  ', '', 'any of us into their ports; and the persons brought  ', '', 'are imprisoned, and their backs lacerated with a cow- ', '', 'skin, cart-whip, or whatever unholy weapon the  ', '', 'deluded hearts of slaveholders may direct them to.   ', '', 'Many of those wretches are colonization men, who  ', '', 'wish to send us across the Atlantic ocean, with the  ', 'pleasing phantom of elevating us to rank, riches,  ', 'wreaths and laurels.  It is my opinion, that some of  ', '', 'their hearts are so deluded, that, were it not for the  ', '', 'blush of humanity and national honor, they would  ', '', 'adopt similar measures taken by the French, at the  ', '', 'commencement of the Haytian revolution, and col- ', '', 'onize us in the depths of the ocean. ', '', '   In thus speaking, I do no presume to suspect our  ', '', 'white brethren collectively; for I believe we have  ', 'sincere friends among them, who are day and night  ', 'studying for our interest and welfare.  We believe  ', '', 'there are more than seven thousand of them who  ', '', 'have not bowed the knee to the modern Baal, the  ', '', 'god of prejudice, pride, and ambition. ', '', '   Such [are] the existing animosities against us, that  ', '', 'we do not feel very safe at home among our friends:  ', '', 'how, then, can we feel secure in a colony established  ', '', 'by slaveholders? ', '   The truth is, brethren, God is at work; though,  ', 'to some of us, reformation seems slow in its progress.   ', '', 'Our situation appears abject and mean; that of our  ', '', 'slave brethren, degrading almost with the brute cre- ', '', 'ation.  This state of things has remained for a long  ', '', 'time; while almost every other relic of barbarism  ', '', 'has been done away by the rapid march of reform.   ', '', 'Yet, however, we have reason to be thankful, that'], ['  much has been done, and is doing, to put a stop to  ', '', 'the unjust existence of slavery.  Some thousands of  ', '', 'us have emerged from that deplorable state into nom- ', 'inal freedom, ', ' a medium between genuine liberty  ', 'and abject slavery.  Genuine liberty consists of lib- ', 'erty of conscience and of person, both civil and po- ', '', 'litical.  We are placed in this intermediate situation,  ', '', 'as the objects of God™s particular care; the forerun- ', '', 'ner of some better enjoyment, which is hastening on  ', '', 'with rapid strides.  Nothing can prove more influen- ', '', 'tial, in the setting forth a universal concern for our  ', '', 'welfare in this country, our native home, than a gen- ', '', 'eral union of interest to raise funds and promote ed- ', 'ucation.  Our present situation will afford means to  ', 'acquire these blessings, which are the avenues that  ', '', 'will lead us to recover our long lost rights, guaran- ', '', 'teed to us by the sacred declaration of our country™s  ', '', 'independence.  These measures have been too long  ', '', 'hid from us under the shades of obscurity, occasioned  ', '', 'by ignorance, &c.  We have remained silent too  ', '', 'long, on the subject of our present thraldom, and suf- ', '', 'fered reproaches to be heaped upon us without an- ', 'swering to the many wrongs wickedly charged against  ', 'us.  Our hands have been too slack in offering our  ', '', 'charities, to be appropriated to our general good;  ', '', 'while the whites of every name and every denomi- ', 'nation are bound together by this one, common tie ', ' the public interest. ', '   It is time, my brethren, for us to consider minute- ', 'ly, and weigh deeply, matters connected with our  ', '', 'national welfare, and take the example of our white  ', '', 'brethren, and do away every petty local prejudice,'], ['    Since we have been brought out of darkness into  ', 'light, we discover something ahead that we have not  ', 'yet come up to.

Prophets have a- ', '', 'risen among them, who hold forth to the people, the  ', '', 'continuation of our political thraldom, unless there  ', '', 'be a general removal of all the free among us to the  ', 'coast of Africa.  Others argue, that, although they'], [' have good feelings towards us, and would do any  ', 'thing for us, if we were out of their sight and out of  ', '', 'hearing of their slaves, yet to admit us into their  ', '', 'circles would be to pervert the present order of so- ', '', 'ciety, and the happiness of the good white citizens  ', '', 'of the country.  These are generally bible men, such  ', '', 'as hold forth the true oracles of God; yet deny him,  ', '', 'in their actions and words, the supreme control over  ', 'all his creatures.  There is hardly ever an action per- ', 'formed, whether good or bad, but there is generally  ', '', 'a reason given for so doing; and he is a wicked,  ', '', 'daring character, who cannot find a cloak, at any  ', '', 'time, to cover his hideous crimes.  The men who have  ', '', 'been foremost, in withholding from us our dearest  ', '', 'and most sacred rights, have always held out false  ', '', 'colors to the community at large, (such as, inferi- ', '', 'ority, degradation, nuisance, pest, slaves, species of  ', 'monkey, apes, &c.) to justify their inhuman and  ', 'unchristian acts towards us, and to deaden the severe  ', '', 'pangs of conscience that harass them.  They would  ', '', 'wish to appear innocent before the world; as doing  ', '', 'unto all men as they would they should do unto them.   ', '', 'Do they base their objects, in full, upon such frivo- ', '', 'lous excuses as these?  No.  The truth is, actions  ', '', 'speak louder than words.  It is my candid opinion,  ', '', 'there would have been no Colonization Society  ', 'formed for our transportation to the western coast of  ', 'Africa, had there been no free colored people, and  ', '', 'did not our numbers increase daily.  If we, as a free  ', '', 'body of people, had remained in the same character  ', '', 'with slaves, monkeys and baboons, there would not  ', '', 'have been so much excitement in the community a- ', '', 'bout us; but as they see, by our improvement, (a'], [' great improvement, indeed, within forty years,) that  ', 'the period is hastening on, when there will be no  ', '', 'other alternative but we must rank among them in  ', '', 'civilization, science and politics, they have got up  ', '', 'this colonization scheme to persuade us to leave our  ', '', 'slave brethren, and flee to the pestilential shores of  ', '', 'Africa, where we shall be in danger of being forced  ', '', 'to hang our harps upon the willows, and our song of  ', 'liberty and civilization will be hushed by the impell- ', 'ing force of barbarian despots. ', '', '   The present situation of our free colored people  ', '', 'has awakened general concern, and aroused general  ', '', 'sympathy in the community, so as to call for their  ', '', 'charities to be appropriated, not to the advancement  ', '', 'of civilization, education, arts and sciences, and the  ', '', 'elevation of our moral, civil and political character  ', '', 'in this country; but, on the contrary, to send us to  ', 'an unknown land, that we can no more justly claim  ', 'than the whites of this country can the continent of  ', '', 'Europe, where we shall be forced to sever the bonds  ', '', 'of affection with our slave brethren, and leave all  ', 'that is near and dear to us, ', ' the ties of country, and  ', 'the graves of our fathers.  Can such charities pro- ', 'ceed from a christian source?  I am persuaded, they  ', 'are based upon prejudice, pride, ambition, jealousy,  ', '', 'hatred, malice, and impure heart; from whence every  ', '', 'other black art has its origin.  And why?  Because  ', '', 'our color and features do not exactly resemble theirs.   ', '', 'If their sympathies proceed from christian principles,  ', '', 'why not adopt the measures taken by patriarch  ', '', 'Abraham and his nephew Lot, as there is plenty of  ', '', 'land on the right hand and on the left, to satisfy the  ', 'calls of humanity?  If that would not answer, why'], ['  not purchase the Texas, or some other neighboring  ', '', 'province, and cede it to us, as a pledge of their faith  ', '', 'towards us, whom they have so long injured; and  ', '', 'break the bonds of slavery asunder at the south, that  ', '', 'two millions of us may, like ancient Israel, march  ', '', 'forward with our flocks, our herds, our wives, and  ', '', 'our little ones, to a country where we shall not be  ', 'so much exposed to the seas and the pestilential va- ', 'pors of the torrid zone?  The reasons are obvious.   ', '', 'Their hearts are hardened against us, like haughty  ', '', 'Pharaoh™s, who would not let Israel go, until visited  ', '', 'by severe plagues and the judgements of an angry  ', '', 'God, who cannot endure and will not uphold injus- ', '', 'tice exercised upon one of his creatures. ', '', '   The profits arising from the sweat and blood of  ', '', 'our brethren, together with the existing ignorance a- ', 'mong us, is the cause of much interest and specula- ', 'tion among our enemies, both in the slaveholding  ', '', 'and non-slaveholding States.  So far as we become  ', '', 'civilized and educated, so far their interest, in the  ', '', 'bones and muscles of our brethren, is at stake[.]   ', '', 'Hence the object of colonizing us on the shores of  ', '', 'Africa; whom they represent as a pest, a nuisance;  ', '', 'and who are likely to lead the slaves to insubordina- ', '', 'tion.  Many have bitterly denied these assertions;  ', 'but as a specimen of their good feelings towards us,  ', 'we will refer, for our satisfaction, to some of the  ', '', 'late resolutions of Virginia, North Carolina, South  ', '', 'Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana; more particularly,  ', '', 'the ordinances of Charleston, Savannah, and New- ', '', 'Orleans; where we, as free people, are not allowed  ', '', 'to set foot upon their shores, except under certain re- ', '', 'strictions; and in some of those places the masters'], ['  of vessels are subject to a heavy fine, for bringing  ', '', 'any of us into their ports; and the persons brought  ', '', 'are imprisoned, and their backs lacerated with a cow- ', '', 'skin, cart-whip, or whatever unholy weapon the  ', '', 'deluded hearts of slaveholders may direct them to.   ', '', 'Many of those wretches are colonization men, who  ', '', 'wish to send us across the Atlantic ocean, with the  ', 'pleasing phantom of elevating us to rank, riches,  ', 'wreaths and laurels.  It is my opinion, that some of  ', '', 'their hearts are so deluded, that, were it not for the  ', '', 'blush of humanity and national honor, they would  ', '', 'adopt similar measures taken by the French, at the  ', '', 'commencement of the Haytian revolution, and col- ', '', 'onize us in the depths of the ocean. ', '', '   In thus speaking, I do no presume to suspect our  ', '', 'white brethren collectively; for I believe we have  ', 'sincere friends among them, who are day and night  ', 'studying for our interest and welfare.  We believe  ', '', 'there are more than seven thousand of them who  ', '', 'have not bowed the knee to the modern Baal, the  ', '', 'god of prejudice, pride, and ambition. ', '', '   Such [are] the existing animosities against us, that  ', '', 'we do not feel very safe at home among our friends:  ', '', 'how, then, can we feel secure in a colony established  ', '', 'by slaveholders? ', '   The truth is, brethren, God is at work; though,  ', 'to some of us, reformation seems slow in its progress.   ', '', 'Our situation appears abject and mean; that of our  ', '', 'slave brethren, degrading almost with the brute cre- ', '', 'ation.  This state of things has remained for a long  ', '', 'time; while almost every other relic of barbarism  ', '', 'has been done away by the rapid march of reform.   ', '', 'Yet, however, we have reason to be thankful, that'], ['  much has been done, and is doing, to put a stop to  ', '', 'the unjust existence of slavery.  Some thousands of  ', '', 'us have emerged from that deplorable state into nom- ', 'inal freedom, ', ' a medium between genuine liberty  ', 'and abject slavery.  Genuine liberty consists of lib- ', 'erty of conscience and of person, both civil and po- ', '', 'litical.  We are placed in this intermediate situation,  ', '', 'as the objects of God™s particular care; the forerun- ', '', 'ner of some better enjoyment, which is hastening on  ', '', 'with rapid strides.  Nothing can prove more influen- ', '', 'tial, in the setting forth a universal concern for our  ', '', 'welfare in this country, our native home, than a gen- ', '', 'eral union of interest to raise funds and promote ed- ', 'ucation.  Our present situation will afford means to  ', 'acquire these blessings, which are the avenues that  ', '', 'will lead us to recover our long lost rights, guaran- ', '', 'teed to us by the sacred declaration of our country™s  ', '', 'independence.  These measures have been too long  ', '', 'hid from us under the shades of obscurity, occasioned  ', '', 'by ignorance, &c.  We have remained silent too  ', '', 'long, on the subject of our present thraldom, and suf- ', '', 'fered reproaches to be heaped upon us without an- ', 'swering to the many wrongs wickedly charged against  ', 'us.  Our hands have been too slack in offering our  ', '', 'charities, to be appropriated to our general good;  ', '', 'while the whites of every name and every denomi- ', 'nation are bound together by this one, common tie ', ' the public interest. ', '   It is time, my brethren, for us to consider minute- ', 'ly, and weigh deeply, matters connected with our  ', '', 'national welfare, and take the example of our white  ', '', 'brethren, and do away every petty local prejudice,'], ['    Since we have been brought out of darkness into  ', 'light, we discover something ahead that we have not  ', 'yet come up to.  It is that which is spoken of in the  ', '', \"Declaration of Independence that 'all men are born  \", '', \"free and equal;' but the sons of Africa are denied  \", 'this freedom and equality, ', 'and, of course, are not  ', 'men, but rather compared to baboons or some other  ', '', 'dumb beasts.  But if we are men, and entitled to the  ', '', 'rights of men, we would ask the people of this re- ', '', 'public whether we must fight for liberty in America,  ', 'and go to Africa to possess it?  If so, we would have  ', 'but little faith in such a warfare.  What recompense  ', '', 'did the blacks get in fighting for liberty in the war  ', 'of the revolution?  I think the answer may be ', \"  'Why, the negroes were recommended for their  \", \"bravery.' \", '  We perceive that a majority of the whites have  ', 'an earnest desire for the removal of the blacks to  ', '', 'Liberia, where they will be out of sight; and we  ', '', 'find that some of the most faithful christians (pretend- ', 'edly) in the United States are to be found in the  ', 'Colonization Society.  We would ask those coloni- ', '', 'zation christians, in what book they have been seek- ', '', 'ing their religion?  Is there any part of Scripture  ', '', 'that authorises a christian to advise his neighbor to go  ', 'out of his own country to an unknown land, when he  ', 'knows it will be an injury to him, because he has a  ', '', 'darker skin than he has?

But, Mr.  ', '', 'President, being assembled here, as you are, to urge,  ', 'to contend for, and to ', 'claim', ' the rights of man ', ' the  ', 'inalienable rights of injured man ', ' the long-with- ', 'held rights of the much abused descendants of  ', 'Afric™s sons ', ' Can ', 'I, an African, be mute on such an  ', 'occasion as this?

', '   My friends, the creation of this vast universe, of  ', '', 'which the globe that we inhabit is but a part, was  ', '', 'not the effect of chance, but was formed by wisdom;  ', '', 'it in consequence, then, requires wisdom to under- ', 'stand the frame of it; the more a man increases in  ', 'wisdom, the more he will understand it ', ' and the  ', 'more he understands, the more he will approve and  ', 'admire it ', ' and the more he approves and admires,  ', 'the more he will be led to love its great Author and  ', 'Creator.  As an illustration of this, we see that the  ', '', 'full perfection of a complex machine in all its parts,  ', '', 'with their relative and respective bearings, and mutual  ', '', 'dependencies on each other, is best compre- ', '', 'hended by an artist familiar with its utility.  Super- ', 'ficial observers see little of it, and condemn ', ' while  ', 'deep thinkers see much and commend. ', '   In His infinite wisdom, then, it pleased Almighty  ', '', 'God, at the creation of the world, (for we must go  ', '', 'tread for awhile the delightful labyrinths of Eden™s'], [' blissful regions,) it, I say, pleased Omnipotence at  ', 'the creation, to confer pre-eminence on man ', ' not  ', 'on any particular man or ', 'class of men', ', but on ', 'man', '  our common ancestor ', ' moulding him after His di- ', 'vine similitude ', ' breathing into his nostrils the eter- ', 'nal life of an immortal soul, and thereby making  ', 'him the most favored being in the creation. ', '  Jehovah further declared that all other animals  ', 'should be subservient to his dominion and control.   ', '', 'Thus was the earth given to man, and to his seed  ', '', 'after him; nor do we find in any one passage of the  ', 'Sacred Writ ', ' the oracles of God™s holy will ', ' any  ', 'authority for making any distinctions between the  ', 'rich and the poor, the white and the black, the  ', '', 'learned and the illiterate, merely on account of these  ', 'differences to trample each the other under foot.

', '', 'Although, then, we recognize the law of God as  ', 'supreme, yet the laws of the society in which it may  ', 'have been our lot to be placed, are for these reasons  ', '', 'binding upon us; and as rational beings we ought  ', '', 'to submit to them, whenever and wherever they do  ', '', 'not conflict with the law of God.  Laws being, as  ', '', 'I have said, framed to check, and to awe, and to  ', '', 'provide for the punishment of the unruly and vicious  ', '', 'passions of certain individuals in the community, to  ', '', 'abrogate such laws would be the height of fanati- ', 'cism and rashness.
